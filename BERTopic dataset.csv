3,Automated Process Monitoring in 3D Printing Using Supervised Machine Learning,"Quality monitoring is still a big challenge in additive manufacturing, popularly known as 3D printing. Detection of defects during the printing process will help eliminate waste of material and time. Defect detection during the initial stages of printing may generate an alert to either pause or stop the printing process so that corrective measures can be taken to prevent the need to reprint the parts. This paper proposes a method to automatically assess the quality of 3D printed parts with the integration of a camera, image processing, and supervised machine learning. Images of semi-finished parts are taken at several critical stages of the printing process according to the part geometry. A machine learning method, support vector machine (SVM), is proposed to classify the parts into either ‘good’ or ‘defective’ category. Parts using ABS and PLA materials were printed to demonstrate the proposed framework. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate how the proposed method works.",3D printing Image processing Supervised machine learning SVM
4,Application of supervised machine learning for defect detection during metallic powder bed fusion additive manufacturing using high resolution imaging.,"Process monitoring in additive manufacturing (AM) is a crucial component in the mission of broadening AM industrialization. However, conventional part evaluation and qualification techniques, such as computed tomography (CT), can only be utilized after the build is complete, and thus eliminate any potential to correct defects during the build process. In contrast to post-build CT, in situ defect detection based on in situ sensing, such as layerwise visual inspection, enables the potential for in-process re-melting and correction of detected defects and thus facilitates in-process part qualification. This paper describes the development and implementation of such an in situ defect detection strategy for powder bed fusion (PBF) AM using supervised machine learning. During the build process, multiple images were collected at each build layer using a high resolution digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera. For each neighborhood in the resulting layerwise image stack, multi-dimensional visual features were extracted and evaluated using binary classification techniques, i.e. a linear support vector machine (SVM). Through binary classification, neighborhoods are then categorized as either a flaw, i.e. an undesirable interruption in the typical structure of the material, or a nominal build condition. Ground truth labels, i.e. the true location of flaws and nominal build areas, which are needed to train the binary classifiers, were obtained from post-build high-resolution 3D CT scan data. In CT scans, discontinuities, e.g. incomplete fusion, porosity, cracks, or inclusions, were identified using automated analysis tools or manual inspection. The xyz locations of the CT data were transferred into the layerwise image domain using an affine transformation, which was estimated using reference points embedded in the part. After the classifier had been properly trained, in situ defect detection accuracies greater than 80% were demonstrated during cross-validation experiments.",Additive manufacturing Powder bed fusion Process monitoring Machine learning Experimental validation
5,Automated Real-Time Detection and Prediction of Interlayer Imperfections in Additive Manufacturing Processes Using Artificial Intelligence,"Although fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing technologies have advanced in the past decade, interlayer imperfections such as delamination and warping are still dominant when printing complex parts. Herein, a self-monitoring system based on real-time camera images and deep learning algorithms is developed to classify the various extents of delamination in a printed part. In addition, a novel method incorporating strain measurements is established to measure and predict the onset of warping. Results show that the machine-learning model is capable of detecting different levels of delamination conditions, and the strain measurements setup successfully reflects and determines the extent and tendency of warping before it actually occurs in the print job. This multifunctional system can be applied to assess other manufacturing processes to realize autocalibration and prediagnosis of imperfections without human interaction.",NONE

7,Real-time defect detection of laser additive manufacturing based on support vector machine,"Laser additive manufacturing is an advanced digital manufacturing technology used to build or repair metal parts layer by layer. However, monitoring and in-process defect diagnosis lag behind advances in other key technologies, which makes product quality control a challenging problem. In this paper, a novel real-time monitoring system is proposed to automatically detect defects using principal component analysis and support vector machine. A camera is used in the image acquisition system to capture molten pool image. Ten molten pool features were extracted and principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensions of the feature set. Support vector machine is used to build a classifier to detect defects in the deposited layer. The experimental results show that the SVM method can achieve high defect detection rate when identifying both slag and bulge defects. The support vector machine has a more satisfactory performance than the RBF neural network method. It is proved that the support vector machine method can be used more accurately and more universally in the in-situ monitoring system of laser additive manufacturing for defect diagnosis.",NONE
8,Using Machine Learning to Analyze Image Data from Advanced Manufacturing Processes,"Additive manufacturing (AM) - also known as 3D printing - promises a new approach to creating parts in a manufacturing environment; the process allows more design freedom and the production of parts with more complex features, compared to traditional manufacturing processes. The laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) printer operates by building a part layer by layer in an iterative process of spreading metal powder and melting the desired shape. One particular feature is an overhang (material being melted onto the part over loose un-melted parts). However, some of the un-melted powder from the process could become melted to the overhanging feature - which is known as dross. Overhangs tend to form dross, but the extent of dross created at these features is not fully understood. Due to this unpredictable nature of dross formation, the build process exhibits variability in build quality, deterring industry-wide adoption. The conducted research aims to develop a system that analyzes cross-sectional image data captured from each layer of the print in order to identify dross with a certain level of confidence. Using machine learning techniques, images are used in a model that identifies pixels as a region that contains dross. These images are first labeled with bounding boxes (a coordinate system that identifies features/objects as existing within its boundaries) to train a neural network. The result is an adaptive model that autonomously detects dross in image scans of the part, pointing out these impurities to the printers' users, especially in regions difficult to inspect like interior surfaces of parts. The model aims to further understand L-PBF processing by location regions of excessive dross to relate dross formation with specific design features.","3D printing, additive manufacturing, neural networks, quality assurance"
9,Distance-Based Multivariate Anomaly Detection in Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing,"Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) offers the possibility to build up large-scale metal parts. Data which is obtained from a multivariate sensor system in-situ must be analyzed automatically to ensure an early and reliable detection of defects to reduce the costs due to production scrap. For that reason, a modular anomaly detector for multivariate time series in WAAM was investigated in this paper. The approach adressed major topics in real-life data sets of industrial applications such as miscellaneous signal sample rates, lack of synchronization and concept drift. A reference data set based on an anomaly-dependently splitted time horizon was defined to reduce the sensitivity loss of the detector after an anomaly. To avoid the need for labeled data, an unsupervised anomaly detection method based on neural networks was used. Hence, no time and costs for artificial defect creation on the machine tool are required when implementing the approach in industrial applications.",Anomaly Detection Time Series Multivariate Additive Manufacturing Machine Learning
10,Detection of powder bed defects in selective laser sintering using convolutional neural network,"The presence of defects in a powder bed fusion (PBF) process can lead to the formation of flaws in consolidated parts. Powder bed defects (PBDs) have different sizes and shapes and occur in different locations in the built area. Those variations pose great challenges to their detection. In this study, a deep convolution neural network was applied to detect three typical types of PBDs in a selective laser sintering (SLS) process, namely warpage, part shifting, and short feed, which were intentionally generated by varying the process conditions. Images of the powder bed were captured using a digital camera, which were split into three single-channel images corresponding to the color channels in the color image. A deep residual neural network was then used to extract multiscale features, and a region proposal network was adopted to detect the object-level defect bounding box. In the final stage, a fully convolutional neural network was proposed to generate instance-level defect regions in the bounding box. Our results demonstrated that this method had higher accuracy and efficiency and was able to cope with geometrical distortion and image blurring, in comparison to the defect detection methods reported previously. Also, the detection system was cost-effective and could be easily installed outside the chamber of a PBF system. This study lays the groundwork for the development of a variety of automated technologies for additive manufacturing, such as real-time powder layer quality inspection and 3D quality certificate generation for finish parts.",Defect Powder bed fusion Detection Neural network Selective laser sintering
11,A deep learning-based model for defect detection in laser-powder bed fusion using in-situ thermographic monitoring,"Additive manufacturing of metal components with laser-powder bed fusion is a very complex process, since powder has to be melted and cooled in each layer to produce a part. Many parameters influence the printing process; however, defects resulting from suboptimal parameter settings are usually detected after the process. To detect these defects during the printing, different process monitoring techniques such as melt pool monitoring or off-axis infrared monitoring have been proposed. In this work, we used a combination of thermographic off-axis imaging as data source and deep learning-based neural network architectures, to detect printing defects. For the network training, a k-fold cross validation and a hold-out cross validation were used. With these techniques, defects such as delamination and splatter can be recognized with an accuracy of 96.80%. In addition, the model was evaluated with computing class activation heatmaps. The architecture is very small and has low computing costs, which means that it is suitable to operate in real time even on less powerful hardware.",Quality assurance Machine learning Additive manufacturing Convolutional neural networks
12,"Toward the digital twin of additive manufacturing: Integrating thermal simulations, sensing, and analytics to detect process faults","The goal of this work is to achieve the defect-free production of parts made using Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. As a step towards this goal, the objective is to detect flaws in AM parts during the process by combining predictions from a physical model (simulation) with in-situ sensor signatures in a machine learning framework. We hypothesize that flaws in AM parts are detected with significantly higher statistical fidelity (F-score) when both in-situ sensor data and theoretical predictions are pooled together in a machine learning model, compared to an approach that is based exclusively on machine learning of sensor data (black-box model) or physics-based predictions (white-box model). We test the hypothesized efficacy of such a gray-box model or digital twin approach in the context of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and directed energy deposition (DED) AM processes. For example, in the DED process, we first predicted the instantaneous spatiotemporal distribution of temperature in a thin-wall titanium alloy part using a computational heat transfer model based on graph theory. Subsequently, we combined the preceding physics-derived thermal trends with in-situ temperature measurements obtained from a pyrometer in a readily implemented supervised machine learning framework (support vector machine). We demonstrate that the integration of temperature predictions from an ab initio heat transfer model and in-situ sensor data is capable of detecting flaws in the DED-produced thin-wall part with F-score approaching 90%. By contrast, the F-score decreases to nearly 80% when either temperature measurements from the in-situ sensor or temperature distribution predictions from the theoretical model are used alone by themselves. This work thus demonstrates an early foray into the digital twin paradigm for real-time process monitoring in AM via seamless integration of physics-based modeling (simulation), in-situ sensing, and data analytics (machine learning).", Additive manufacturing digital twin thermal simulations graph theory data analytics machine learning sensors laser powder bed fusion directed energy deposition thermal cameraphotodetectorpyrometerporositymeltpoolthin-walloverhang
13,Data fusion methods for statistical process monitoring and quality characterization in metal additive manufacturing,"Metal additive manufacturing (AM) technologies enable the production of complex shapes, lightweight structures and novel functional features. Such increased complexity of the products imposes various challenges in terms of statistical process monitoring and quality assessment. However, one great potential of AM processes, compared to conventional ones, consists of the possibility of gathering a large amount of data layer by layer. This study investigates a data fusion methodology to combine in-situ data from multiple sensors embedded in Electron Beam Melting (EBM) systems to automatically detect faults and process errors. The aim consists of making sense of information already available from the system to enhance its embedded intelligence via novel data mining techniques. A real case study in EBM is presented and discussed.",Electron beam melting data fusions tatistical process monitoring support vector machine
14,Layerwise Anomaly Detection in Laser Powder-Bed Fusion Metal Additive Manufacturing,"A growing research trend in additive manufacturing (AM) calls for layerwise anomaly detection as a step toward enabling real-time process control, in contrast to ex situ or postprocess testing and characterization. We propose a method for layerwise anomaly detection during laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) metal AM. The method uses high-speed thermal imaging to capture melt pool temperature and is composed of the following four-step anomaly detection procedure: (1) using the captured thermal images, a process signature of a just-fabricated layer is generated. Next, a signature difference is obtained by subtracting the process signature of that particular layer from a prespecified reference signature, (2) a screening step selects potential regions of interests (ROIs) within the layer that are likely to contain process anomalies, hence reducing the computational burden associated with analyzing the full layer data, (3) the spatial dependence of these ROIs is modeled using a Gaussian process model, and then pixels with statistically significant deviations are flagged, and (4) using the quantity and the spatial pattern of the flagged pixels as predictors, a classifier is trained and implemented to determine whether the process is in- or out-of-control. We validate the proposed method using a case study on a commercial L-PBF system custom-instrumented with a dual-wavelength imaging pyrometer for capturing the thermal images during fabrication.","anomaly detection, Gaussian processes, metal additive manufacturing, process monitoring, spatial statistics, two-wavelength pyrometer"
15,Linking pyrometry to porosity in additively manufactured metals,"Porosity in additively manufactured metals can reduce material strength and is generally undesirable. Although studies have shown relationships between process parameters and porosity, monitoring strategies for defect detection and pore formation are still needed. In this paper, instantaneous anomalous conditions are detected in-situ via pyrometry during laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing and correlated with voids observed using post-build micro-computed tomography. Large two-color pyrometry data sets were used to estimate instantaneous temperatures, melt pool orientations and aspect ratios. Machine learning algorithms were then applied to processed pyrometry data to detect outlier images and conditions. It is shown that melt pool outliers are good predictors of voids observed post-build. With this approach, real time process monitoring can be incorporated into systems to detect defect and void formation. Alternatively, using the methodology presented here, pyrometry data can be post processed for porosity assessment.",Laser powder bed fusion Insitu monitoring Pyrometry Porosity Data analytics
16,Heterogeneous sensor-based condition monitoring in directed energy deposition,"The objective of this work is to detect in situ the occurrence of lack-of-fusion defects in titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4_V) parts made using directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing (AM). We use data from two types of in-process sensors, namely, a spectrometer and an optical camera which are integrated into an Optomec MR-7 DED machine. Both sensors are focused on capturing the dynamic phenomena around the melt pool region. To detect lack-of-fusion defects, we fuse (combine) the data from the in-process sensors invoking the concept of Kronecker product of graphs. Subsequently, we use the features derived from the graph Kronecker product as inputs to a machine learning algorithm to predict the severity (class or level) of average length of lack-of-fusion defects within a layer, which is obtained from offline X-ray computed tomography of the test parts. We demonstrate that the severity of lack-of-fusion defects is classified with statistical fidelity (F-score) close to 85% for a two-level classification scenario, and approximately 70% for a three-level classification scenario. Accordingly, this work demonstrates the use of heterogeneous in-process sensing and online data analytics for in situ detection of defects in DED metal AM process.",Directed energy deposition Lack-of-fusion defects In-process optical emission spectroscopy Plume imaging Kronecker graph product Sensor data fusion

Our approach is designed to not only detect whether there exists an anomaly at a given time step, but also to predict what will happen next in the (sequential) process. We demonstrate our approach on a dataset collected from a real-world Additive Manufacturing (AM) testbed. The dataset contains infrared (IR) images collected under both normal conditions and synthetic anomalies. We show that our encoder-decoder model is able to identify the injected anomalies in a modern AM manufacturing process in an unsupervised fashion. In addition, our approach also gives hints about the temperature non-uniformity of the testbed during manufacturing, which was not previously known prior to the experiment.",additive manufacturing machine learning anomaly detection fault detection and diagnosis

In this study, a new real-time defect identification method is proposed for Al alloys in robotic arc welding, using arc optical spectroscopy and an integrated learning method. Spectrum feature was extracted, based on the absolute coefficients of the principal components. Feature importance was quantitatively evaluated using the mean decrease accuracy of Principal Component Analysis-Random Forest (PCA-RF). A new indicator, e.g., Importance Factor, was proposed, based on the variance of the out-of-bag test error of RF to select the optimal feature subset. The proposed PCA-RF proved to effectively identify five classes of weld defects with better performance than support vector machine and back propagation neural network. Finally, the selection pattern of spectrum feature subset was investigated, before revealing the correlation mechanism of the selected lines spectrum and weld process.",Optical spectroscopy Aluminum alloy welding Defect on-line identification Principal component analysis Random forest
19,In-situ droplet inspection and closed-loop control system using machine learning for liquid metal jet printing,"Liquid Metal Jet Printing (LMJP) is a revolutionary three-dimensional (3D) printing technique in fast but low-cost additive manufacturing. The driving force is produced by magneto-hydrodynamic property of liquid metal in an alternating magnetic field. Due to its integrated melting and ink-jetting process, it can achieve 10x faster speed at 1/10th of the cost as compared to current metal 3D printing techniques. However, the jetting process is influenced by many uncertain factors, which impose a significant challenge to its process stability and product quality. To address this challenge, we present a closed-loop control framework by seamlessly integrating vision-based technique and neural network tool to inspect droplet behaviours and accordingly stabilize the printing process. This system automatically tunes the drive voltage applied to compensate the uncertain influence based on vision inspection result. To realize this, we first extract multiple features and properties from images to capture the droplet behaviour. Second, we use a neural network together with PID control process to determine how the drive voltage should be adjusted. We test this system on a piezoelectric-based ink-jetting emulator, which has a very similar jetting mechanism to the LMJP. Results show that significantly more stable jetting behavior can be obtained in real-time. This system can also be applied to other droplet related applications owing to its universally applicable characteristics.",Additive manufacturing Metal jetting Process inspection Closed-loop control Vision Neural network

22,Improving surface finish quality in extrusion-based 3D concrete printing using machine learning-based extrudate geometry control,"3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) has been gaining popularity in the past few years. Due to the nature of line-by-line printing and the slump of the material deposition in each extruded line, 3D printed structures exhibit obvious lines or marks at the layer interface, which affects surface finish quality and potentially affect bonding strength between layers. This makes it necessary to control the extrudate formation in 3DCP. However, it is difficult to directly analyse the extrudate formation process because the extrudate shape depends on many parameters. In this paper, a machine learning technique is applied to correlate the formation of the extrudate to the printing parameters using an Artificial Neural Network model. The training data for the model development was obtained from extrudates printed in 3DCP experiments. The performance of the trained model was experimentally validated and the predicted extrudate geometry resulting from the developed model showed good agreement to the actual extrudate geometry. Subsequently, the developed model was used to find proper nozzle shapes to produce designated extrudate geometries. Significant improvement on the printing quality was demonstrated using nozzle shapes generated from the model on 3D printed objects consisting a vertical wall, an inclined wall and a curved part.",NONE
23,Use of Data Mining Techniques for the Prediction of Surface Roughness of Printed Parts in Polylactic Acid (PLA) by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM): A Practical Application in Frame Glasses Manufacturing,"In the present work, ten data mining algorithms have been used to generate models capable of predicting the surface roughness of parts printed on polylactic acid (PLA) by using fused deposition modeling (FDM). The models have been trained using experimental data measured on 27 horizontal (XY) and 27 vertical (XZ) specimens, printed using different values for the parameters studied (layer height, extrusion temperature, print speed, print acceleration and flow). The models generated by multilayer perceptron (MLP) and logistic model trees (LMT) have obtained the best results in a cross-validation. Although it does not obtain such optimal results, the J48 algorithm (C4.5) allows the generation of models in the form of a decision tree. These trees permit to determine which print parameters have an influence on the surface roughness. For XY specimens, the surface roughness measured in the direction parallel to the extrusion path (Ra,0,XY ) depends on the flow, the print temperature and the layer height; in the direction perpendicular to the extrusion path, the surface roughness (Ra,90,XY) depends only on the flow. For XZ specimens, the surface roughness measured in the direction parallel to the extrusion path (Ra,0,XZ) depends only on the print speed; in the direction perpendicular to the extrusion path (Ra,90,XZ), it depends on the layer height and the extrusion temperature. According to the study carried out, the most suitable set up provides values of Ra,0,XY, Ra,90,XY, Ra,0,XZ and Ra,90,XZ equal to 0.46, 1.18, 0.45 and 11.54, respectively.

Nowadays, the customization of biomedical parts is becoming possible due to the increasing accuracy and enhanced ability of FDM machines to control the process parameters. The control on surface quality of parts produced by FDM process is of prime concern for the researchers, which are induced due to the stair steps on sloping surfaces, and needs addressing. In addition, to meet customer demands rapidly, the FDM part build time must be reduced without much compromising the strength of the parts necessary for specific applications.

29,Machine Learning for Optimizing Technological Properties of Wood Composite Filament-Timberfill Fabricated by Fused Deposition Modeling,"This work evaluates the applicability of machine learning (ML) tools in additive manufacturing (AM) processes. One of the most employed AM techniques is fused deposition modeling (FDM), where a part is created from a computer-aided design (CAD) model using layer-by-layer deposition of a feedstock plastic filament material extruded through a nozzle. Owing to the large number of parameters involved in the manufacturing process, it is necessary to identify printing parameters ranges to improve mechanical properties as yield and ultimate strength. In that sense, ML has proven to be a reliable tool in engineering and materials processing, where hybrid ML algorithms are the best alternative since one-part acts as a forecaster, and the other part acts as an optimizer. To evaluate the performance of wood composite filament fabricated by FDM a uniaxial tensile test was performed at room temperature. The experimental procedure was carried out with a design of experiments of four factors at three levels, where the statistical significance of layer thickness, fill density, printing speed and raster angle was obtained as well as their interactions. Furthermore, ML’s algorithm accuracy was explored, where a neuro-fuzzy system (ANFIS) was trained and tested with the experimental data.

To do so, six different convolutional neural network architectures were developed to analyze the process’ molten pool image acquired by a 50-fps coaxial camera. Those networks receive both the camera image and the process parameters as inputs, yielding width and height of the clad beads as outputs. The results of the network’s performances show testing error mean values as little as 8 μm for clad beads around a millimeter in height. For the width dimension, in 95% of the cases, the error remained under 15% of the bead’s width. Plots of the target versus the estimated values show coefficients of determination over 0.95 on the testing set. The architectures are then compared, and their performances are discussed. Deeper convolutional layers far exceeded the performance of shallower ones; nonetheless, deeper densely connected layers decreased the performances of the networks when compared with shallower ones. Those results represent yet another alternative on intelligent process monitoring with potential for real-time usage, taking the researches one step further into developing a closed-loop control for this process.",
33,Automatic quality assessments of laser powder bed fusion builds from photodiode sensor measurements,"While Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) machines have greatly improved in recent years, the L-PBF process is still susceptible to several types of defect formation. Among the monitoring methods that have been explored to detect these defects, camera-based systems are the most prevalent. However, using only photodiode measurements to monitor the build process has potential benefits, as photodiode sensors are cost-efficient and typically have a higher sample rate compared to cameras. This study evaluates whether a combination of photodiode sensor measurements, taken during L-PBF builds, can be used to predict measures of the resulting build quality via a purely data-based approach. Using several unsupervised clustering approaches build density is classified with up to 93.54% accuracy using features extracted from three different photodiodes, as well as observations relating to the energy transferred to the material. Subsequently, a supervised learning method (Gaussian Process regression) is used to directly predict build density with a RMS error of 3.65%. The study, therefore, shows the potential for machine-learning algorithms to predict indicators of L-PBF build quality from photodiode build measurements only. This study also shows that, relative to the L-PBF process parameters, photodiode measurements can contribute to additional information regarding L-PBF part quality. Moreover, the work herein describes approaches that are predominantly probabilistic, thus facilitating uncertainty quantification in machine-learnt predictions of L-PBF build quality.",
34,Machine Learning to Optimize Additive Manufacturing Parameters for Laser Powder Bed Fusion of Inconel 718,"Approximately 3600 samples have been printed to characterize the build parameters for laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) fabrication of Inconel 718. The tested samples connect pore formation to part orientation, part location and the use of recycled powder. These data serve as the basis for development of a Random Forest Network machine learning (ML) model capable of two-way modeling of process–property and process–structure relationships. These results show how common procedural steps in the setup and execution of L-PBF effect porosity, particularly the formation of keyhole and lack of fusion (LOF) defects, and how data collection, processing, and validation can expose even subtle connections between input features and output parameters using a general ML framework.",
35,Porosity prediction: Supervised-learning of thermal history for direct laser deposition,"The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the melt pool characteristics and the defect occurrence in an as-built additive manufacturing part. One of the major detrimental microstructure properties associated with additive manufacturing (AM) is porosity within final parts. State-of-the-art porosity detection methods focus primarily on post-manufacturing approaches that are susceptible to high cost of process, longer process time, and are incapable of characterizing pores during fabrication. A real-time porosity prediction method is developed using morphological characteristics of the melt pool boundary (i.e., features obtained via functional principal component analysis (FPCA)). A thermal monitoring system is used to capture the time-varying melt pool signal, which are labeled as either pores or normal melt pools by X-ray tomography. Supervised learning methods are utilized to identify the patterns of melt pool images and build a black-box model for the probability distribution of class labels (namely, porosity) based on data characteristics of predictors (e.g., melt pool characteristics). The resultant model does not depend on specific design of specimens with varying material properties; and can be effectively developed as long as thermal-porosity data can be obtained. In the current study, multiple supervised machine learning approaches are used to classify melt pools to predict porosity in a part. Two different accuracy measures are used and numerical experiments show that among the classification approaches used (i.e., Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)), KNN results in the highest rate of accurately classifying melt pools (98.44%). However, DT results in the lowest rate for incorrectly identifying normal melt pools as pores (0.03%). A comparative study is conducted that compares the performance of supervised learning methods leveraging the proposed morphological model and simple metrics of the melt pool. Numerical experiments show that the morphological model combined with supervised learning techniques vastly outperform the simple melt pool metrics combined with supervised learning techniques (approximately 250% better performance for correctly predicting abnormal melt pools). Our approach may potentially be applied to other AM processes that share similar energy-material interactions (e.g., powder bed fusion, electron beam melting).",
36,Modelling of laser powder bed fusion process and analysing the effective parameters on surface characteristics of Ti-6Al-4V,"In this paper, we propose a model to predict the average surface roughness (Sa) and analyse the effect of related process parameters on laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) selective laser melting (SLM) of Ti-6Al-4 V. The additive manufacturing (AM) process has various independent parameters that affect the quality of the produced parts and is complex to analyse. Although the process parameters can be selected separately in LPBF, they do however affect each other. Therefore, large adjustments of process parameters is not possible due to the negative effect they have on each other which can lead to problems such as cracks, balling, unmelted powders, porosity, and distortion. A range of process parameters using Taguchi L25 design of experiment (DOE) with five repetitions for each sample has been selected. Then, an artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to the model to predict the value of (arithmetical mean height)/(average surface roughness) (Sa). The selected processing parameters are laser power, scan speed, hatch spacing, laser pattern increment angle, and heat treatment (HT) condition. The present work revolves around ANN modeling and using a wide parameter range and a large number of test samples under ASTM standards as well as adding HT to the DOE to analyse the simultaneous effect of HT and changing process parameters on surface characteristics. A large and precise data set with high generality and reliability obtained by 3750 profilometries on 125 samples. The contribution of this paper is using ANN as an accurate tool in surface modeling and characterizing the effective parameters on the surface of LPBF parts. The existence phenomena and governing factors were explained by introducing new parametric mechanisms in rheology of melting pool. In AM of metals, the variation of average roughness in overlap of hatches can be 5–7 times higher than the centre of the track. Therefore, Sa was selected to have consistency in the measured roughness values. Results showed heat treatment above beta phase transus leads to a local flow of material at the surface causing an increase of Sa. The ranking of influential factors on Sa from the highest to the lowest was found to be: heat treatment > laser power > scan pattern angle > hatch space > scan speed.",
37,Optimization of Cold Metal Transfer-Based Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing Processes Using Gaussian Process Regression,"Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is among the most promising additive manufacturing techniques for metals because it yields high productivity at low raw material costs. However, additional post-processing is required to remove redundant surface material from components manufactured by the WAAM process, and thus the productivity decreases. To increase productivity, multi-variable process parameters need to be optimized, including thermo-mechanical effects caused by high deposition rates. When the process is modeled, deposit shape and productivity are challenging to quantify due to uncertainty in multiple variables of the complicated WAAM process. Therefore, we modeled the WAAM process parameters, including uncertainties, using a Gaussian process regression (GPR) method, thus allowing us to develop a WAAM optimization model to improve both productivity and the quality of the deposit shape. The accuracy of the optimized output was verified through a close agreement with experimental values. The optimized deposited material had a wide effective area ratio, small height differences, and near 90° deposition angle, highlighting the usefulness of the GPR model approach to deposit nearly ideal material shapes.",
38,Data analytics approach for melt-pool geometries in metal additive manufacturing,"Modern data analytics was employed to understand and predict physics-based melt-pool formation by fabricating Ni alloy single tracks using powder bed fusion. An extensive database of melt-pool geometries was created, including processing parameters and material characteristics as input features. Correlation analysis provided insight for relationships between process parameters and melt-pools, and enabled the development of meaningful machine learning models via the use of highly correlated features. We successfully demonstrated that data analytics facilitates understanding of the inherent physics and reliable prediction of melt-pool geometries. This approach can serve as a basis for the melt-pool control and process optimization.",
39,Modelling and parameter optimization for filament deformation in 3D cementitious material printing using support vector machine,"The material flow mechanism affects the printing quality considerably in 3D cementitious material printing (3DCMP) area. A numerical model was developed to investigate the material flow mechanism during the extrusion and deposition process. To quantify the effects of flow mechanism on the filament printing quality, deformation of the printed filament was proposed. Then a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to study various factors on flow mechanism, hence the deformation of the printed filament. The SVM model results showed that deformation of the printed filament is independent of plastic viscosity, however, material yield stress and relative nozzle travel speed significantly affect the deformation of the printed filament. Lastly, an empirical parametric associative model was proposed to predict the filament deformation based on material yield stress and relative nozzle travel speed.",
40,Optimized hatch space selection in double-scanning track selective laser melting process,"Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques such as selective laser melting (SLM) have many advantages over traditional manufacturing methods. However, the quality of SLM products is critically dependent on the process parameters, e.g., the laser power, scanning speed, powder layer thickness, hatch space, and scan length. Determining the parameter settings which optimize the product quality is a challenging, but extremely important problem for manufacturers. In a previous study, the present group determined the optimal values of the laser power and scanning speed for 316L stainless steel powder beds. The present study extends this work to investigate the effects of the hatch space and scan length on the melting pool characteristics in a double-scanning track SLM process. A three-dimensional finite element model is constructed to predict the features of the scan track melt pool for various values of the hatch space and scan length. A circle packing design method is then used to select a representative set of hatch space and scan length parameters to train artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the melt pool temperature, melt pool depth, and overlap rate between adjacent tracks. Finally, the trained ANNs are used to create process maps relating the scan track features to the hatch space and scan length. The optimal hatch space and scan length region of the temperature process map is then determined based on a joint consideration of the peak temperature (less than 3300 K), the difference in depth of adjacent melt pools (less than 10 μm), and the overlap rate of adjacent scan tracks (25~35%). The results indicate that the optimal hatch space is equal to 61% of the laser spot size given an SLM system with a laser power of 180 W, a scanning speed of 680 mm/s, a laser spot size of 120 μm, and a 316L SS powder layer thickness of 50 μm.",
41,A Framework for Optimizing Process Parameters in Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) Process Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN),"Powder bed fusion (PBF) process is a metal additive manufacturing process, which can build parts with any complexity from a wide range of metallic materials. Research in the PBF process predominantly focuses on the impact of a few parameters on the ultimate properties of the printed part. The lack of a systematic approach to optimizing the process parameters for a better performance of given material results in a sub-optimal process. This process needs a comprehensive study of all the influential parameters and their impact on the mechanical and microstructural properties of a fabricated part. Furthermore, there is a need to develop a quantitative system for mapping the material properties and process parameters with the ultimate quality of the fabricated part to achieve improvement in the manufacturing cycle as well as the quality of the final part produced by the PBF process. To address the aforementioned challenges, this research proposes a framework to optimize the process for 316L stainless steel material. This framework characterizes the influence of process parameters on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated part using a series of experiments. These experiments study the significance of process parameters and their variance as well as study the microstructure and mechanical properties of fabricated parts by conducting tensile, impact, hardness, surface roughness, and densification tests, and ultimately obtain the optimum range of parameters. This would result in a more complete understanding of the correlation between process parameters and part quality. Furthermore, these experiments provide the required data needed to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to optimize process parameters (for achieving the desired properties) and estimate fabrication time.",
42,A prediction model for finding the optimal laser parameters in additive manufacturing of NiTi shape memory alloy,"Shape memory alloys (SMAs) have been applied for various applications in the fields of aerospace, automotive, and medical. Nickel-titanium (NiTi) is the most well-known alloy among the others due to its outstanding functional characteristics including superelasticity (SE) and shape memory effect (SME). These particular properties are the result of the reversible martensite-to-austenite and austenite-to-martensite transformations. In recent years, additive manufacturing (AM) has provided a great opportunity for fabricating NiTi products with complex shapes. Many researchers have been investigating the AM process to set the optimal operational parameters, which can significantly affect the properties of the end-products. Indeed, the functional and mechanical behavior of printed NiTi parts can be tailored by controlling laser power, laser scan speed, and hatch spacing having them a crucial role in properties of 3D-printed parts. In particular, the effect of the input parameters can significantly alter the mechanical properties such as strain recovery rates and the transformation temperatures; therefore, using suitable parameter combination is of paramount importance. In this framework, the present study develops a prediction model based on artificial neural network (ANN) to generate a nonlinear map between inputs and outputs of the AM process. Accordingly, a prototyping tool for the AM process, also useful for dealing with the settings of the optimal operational parameters, will be built, tested, and validated.",
43,Process design of laser powder bed fusion of stainless steel using a Gaussian process-based machine learning model,"In this work, a Gaussian process (GP)-based machine learning model is developed to predict the remelted depth of single tracks, as a function of combined laser power and laser scan speed in a laser powder bed fusion process. The GP model is trained by both simulation and experimental data from the literature. The mean absolute prediction error magnified by the GP model is only 0.6 μm for a powder bed with layer thickness of 30 μm, suggesting the adequacy of the GP model. Then, the process design maps of two metals, 316L and 17-4 PH stainless steels, are developed using the trained model. The normalized enthalpy criterion of identifying keyhole mode is evaluated for both stainless steels. For 316L, the result suggests that the Δ𝐻ℎ𝑠≥30 criterion should be related to the powder layer thickness. For 17-4 PH, the criterion should be revised to Δ𝐻ℎ𝑠≥25.",
45,Optimization of parameters of micro-plasma transferred arc additive manufacturing process using real coded genetic algorithm,"Micro-plasma transferred arc additive manufacturing (μ-PTAAM) process developed at IIT Indore has proven be an energy and material efficient additive manufacturing process for various meso-scale ALM applications of high melting point metallic materials. This paper reports on optimization of three most important parameters (i.e. micro-plasma power, worktable travel rate and wire feed rate) of μ-PTAAM process by real coded genetic algorithms so as to minimize the aspect ratio (i.e. ratio of deposition width to deposition height) with an overall objective to increase productivity of this process. Objective function for aspect ratio was formulated using generic theoretical thermal developed in terms of μ-PTAAM process parameters and properties of the substrate and deposition material and models developed using regression analysis and artificial neural networks (ANN). It gave optimized values of micro-plasma power as 370, 355 and 360 W, respectively, by the thermal model, regression model and ANN model, and that of travel speed of worktable and wire feed rate as 100 mm/min and as 1700 mm/min by all three models. The optimized results were validated experimentally by depositing 0.3-mm diameter wire of P20 on 5-mm-thick substrate of the same material. The optimized values of the aspect ratio using objective function based generic thermal model, regression model and ANN model are 1.15, 1.31 and 1.36, respectively, with corresponding experimental values being 1.48, 1.5 and 1.48, respectively. Use of optimum process parameters resulted in very good quality and accuracy of the deposition which has excellent bonding with the substrate material and no internal defects.",
46,Using machine learning to aid in the parameter optimisation process for metal-based additive manufacturing,"Metal-based additive manufacturing is a relatively new technology used to fabricate metal objects within an entirely digital workflow. However, only a small number of different metals are proven for this process. This is partly due to the need to find a new set of parameters which can be used to successfully build an object for every new alloy investigated. There are dozens of variables which contribute to a successful set of parameters and process parameter optimisation is currently a manual process which relies on human judgement.
Here, we demonstrate the application of Machine Learning as an alternative method to determine this set of process parameters, the subject of this test is the processing of pure copper in a laser powder bed fusion printer. Data in the form of optical images were collected over the course of traditional parameter optimisation. These images were segmented and fed into a convolutional autoencoder and then clustered in order to find the clusters which best represented a high-quality result. The clusters were manually scored according to their quality and the results applied to the original set of parameters.
It was found that the machine-learned clustering and subsequent scoring reflected many of the observations which were found in the traditional parameter optimisation process.
This exercise, as well as demonstrating the effectiveness of the ML approach, indicates an opportunity to fully automate the approach to process optimisation by applying labels to the data, hence, an approach that could also potentially be suited for on-the-fly process optimisation.",
47,Modeling and analysis of significant process parameters of FDM 3D printer using ANFIS,"The present work deals with the effects of significant parameters of the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printer on the tensile strength of materials like PETG, ABS and multi-material (60% ABS + 40% PETG). The significant process parameters have been taken as extrusion temperature, layer height and material density. ASTM D638-(IV) standard test specimens have been prepared at different process parameters of the FDM 3D printer to check their tensile strength. UNITEK 94100 Universal testing machine is used to test the tensile strength of test specimens. Thirty experiments have been performed on the UTM machine with various materials and their tensile strength has been recorded as output response. The training between input and output data has been given with ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System). It is observed that maximum tensile strength achieved is 0.0405 kN/mm2 for PETG (material density 1.27 g/cm3) when it is fabricated with 0.1 mm layer height and 225 °C extrusion temperature and ANFIS model is successfully performing for giving output on new input parameters with 2.63 percent error.",
48,The estimation of the laser point temperature based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Network),"For the requirements of the laser temperature in additive manufacturing, there is a high precision and high heat need in the industry. The method is proposed to estimate the temperature of laser point, which is based on CNN. In this method, a model of CNN is carried out. The collected laser thermal radiation images are used to train the model. Image recognition and isotherm estimation can be obtained by the trained model. The conclusion can be verified by the experiment. The isotherm and temperature of the laser can be measured efficiently in this method.",
49,Powder-bed fusion process monitoring by machine vision with hybrid convolutional neural networks,"In this article, a method of hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed for powder-bed fusion (PBF) process monitoring. The proposed method can learn both the spatial and temporal representative features from the raw images automatically based on the advantages of the CNN architecture. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with the traditional methods with handcrafted features. The overall detection accuracy of four process conditions, e.g., overheating, normal, irregularity, and balling, can be up to 0.997. In addition, it is found that the temporal information for PBF process monitoring by the vision detection of the process zone (including melt pool, plume, and spatters) is significant. As the proposed method can save image processing steps, it simplifies the procedure on feature extraction. This makes it more suitable for online monitoring applications.",
50,Laser processing quality monitoring by combining acoustic emission and machine learning: a high-speed X-ray imaging approach,"In situ and real-time monitoring of laser processes are very challenging due to complex dynamics of the laser-matter interactions. Acoustic emission (AE) technique is often used as non-destructive monitoring of many kinds of processes. However, acoustic emission is not industrialized for laser processing for two reasons. First, the signals are too sensitive to the environmental noises. Second, a correlation of the acoustic emission signal with the real events is very difficult to realize despite being of utmost importance. To overcome these difficulties, we combined fast hard X-ray imaging with acoustic sensors and state-of-the-art machine learning.",
51,A Deep Learning Approach for the Identification of Small Process Shifts in Additive Manufacturing using 3D Point Clouds,"Additive manufacturing (AM) refers to a family of manufacturing technologies that fabricate parts by joining materials layer by layer. It has a high level of flexibility in design and manufacturing, which provides a unique opportunity for producing parts with complex geometries that are not feasible using conventional subtractive manufacturing. Due to the sensitivity of AM to machine settings and process conditions, process shifts are oftentimes incurred in AM, which introduce defects and impact the quality and reliability of AM products. As such, it is critical to identify AM process shifts, especially at the incipient stage, for quality assurance. Most existing approaches, however, are limited in their ability to detect small AM process shifts. In this study, a structured light scanner is used to capture 3D point clouds from printed surfaces. A deep learning framework is introduced to extract useful information from point cloud data to delineate geometric variations of the printed surface and detect process shifts. The research methodology is evaluated and validated using both simulation studies and real-world applications. Experimental results have shown that the deep learning approach is with remarkable ability in detecting small process shifts and it outperforms convolutional neural network models when large amounts of training samples are not available. The proposed framework has a strong potential to be used for in-situ layer-wise monitoring of AM processes for quality control and the detection of cyber-physical attacks.",
52,Heterogeneous sensor-based condition monitoring in directed energy deposition,"The objective of this work is to detect in situ the occurrence of lack-of-fusion defects in titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4 V) parts made using directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing (AM). We use data from two types of in-process sensors, namely, a spectrometer and an optical camera which are integrated into an Optomec MR-7 DED machine. Both sensors are focused on capturing the dynamic phenomena around the melt pool region. To detect lack-of-fusion defects, we fuse (combine) the data from the in-process sensors invoking the concept of Kronecker product of graphs. Subsequently, we use the features derived from the graph Kronecker product as inputs to a machine learning algorithm to predict the severity (class or level) of average length of lack-of-fusion defects within a layer, which is obtained from offline X-ray computed tomography of the test parts. We demonstrate that the severity of lack-of-fusion defects is classified with statistical fidelity (F-score) close to 85% for a two-level classification scenario, and approximately 70% for a three-level classification scenario. Accordingly, this work demonstrates the use of heterogeneous in-process sensing and online data analytics for in situ detection of defects in DED metal AM process.",
53,Porosity prediction: Supervised-learning of thermal history for direct laser deposition,"The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the melt pool characteristics and the defect occurrence in an as-built additive manufacturing part. One of the major detrimental microstructure properties associated with additive manufacturing (AM) is porosity within final parts. State-of-the-art porosity detection methods focus primarily on post-manufacturing approaches that are susceptible to high cost of process, longer process time, and are incapable of characterizing pores during fabrication. A real-time porosity prediction method is developed using morphological characteristics of the melt pool boundary (i.e., features obtained via functional principal component analysis (FPCA)). A thermal monitoring system is used to capture the time-varying melt pool signal, which are labeled as either pores or normal melt pools by X-ray tomography. Supervised learning methods are utilized to identify the patterns of melt pool images and build a black-box model for the probability distribution of class labels (namely, porosity) based on data characteristics of predictors (e.g., melt pool characteristics). The resultant model does not depend on specific design of specimens with varying material properties; and can be effectively developed as long as thermal-porosity data can be obtained. In the current study, multiple supervised machine learning approaches are used to classify melt pools to predict porosity in a part. Two different accuracy measures are used and numerical experiments show that among the classification approaches used (i.e., Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)), KNN results in the highest rate of accurately classifying melt pools (98.44%). However, DT results in the lowest rate for incorrectly identifying normal melt pools as pores (0.03%). A comparative study is conducted that compares the performance of supervised learning methods leveraging the proposed morphological model and simple metrics of the melt pool. Numerical experiments show that the morphological model combined with supervised learning techniques vastly outperform the simple melt pool metrics combined with supervised learning techniques (approximately 250% better performance for correctly predicting abnormal melt pools). Our approach may potentially be applied to other AM processes that share similar energy-material interactions (e.g., powder bed fusion, electron beam melting).",
54,Rapid surface defect identification for additive manufacturing with in-situ point cloud processing and machine learning,"Surface monitoring is an essential part of quality assurance for additive manufacturing (AM). Surface defects need to be identified early in the AM process to avoid further deterioration of the part quality. In this paper, a rapid surface defect identification method for directed energy deposition (DED) is proposed. The main contribution of this work is the development of an in-situ point cloud processing with machine learning methods that enable automatic surface monitoring without sensor intermittence. An in-house software platform with a multi-nodal architecture is developed. In-situ point cloud processing steps, including filtering, segmentation, surface-to-point distance calculation, point clustering, and machine learning feature extraction, are performed by multiple subprocesses running simultaneously. The combined unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques are applied to detect and classify surface defects. The proposed method is experimentally validated, and a surface defect identification accuracy of 93.15% is achieved.",
55,A machine learning approach of lattice infill pattern for increasing material efficiency in additive manufacturing processes,"Additive Manufacturing (AM) has become ubiquitous in manufacturing three-dimensional objects through 3D printing. Traditional analytical models are still widely utilized for low–cost 3D Printing, which is deficient in terms of process, structure, property and performance relationship for AM. This paper focuses on the introduction of a new infill pattern–the lattice infill to increase material efficiency of 3D prints, coupled with Machine Learning (ML) technique to address geometric corrections in modelling the shape deviations of AM. Encompassed by ML algorithms, the neural network (NN) is used to handle the large dataset of the system. The 3D coordinates of the proposed infill pattern are extracted as the input of the NN model. The optimization technique of scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) is the algorithm used to train the feedforward ANN, and sigmoidal function was used as the activation type for output neurons. There is 0.00776625 cross-entropy (CE) performance and 98.8% accuracy during network training. The trained network is implemented to STL file for geometric corrections of the lattice infill pattern then made in a 3D printer slicing software. Conventional designs such as the cubic and grid infill pattern were also made for comparison. Engineering simulation software were used to simulate all three infill patterns, to measure approximate product weight, stress performance and displacement, given that there is an external force applied. Comparisons showed that the new infill pattern is more efficient than conventional infill patterns saving material up to 61.3%. Essentially increasing the amount of prints produced per spool by 2.5 times. The structure of the proposed design can also resist up to 1.6 kN of compressive load prior to breaking.",
56,"Real-time FDM machine condition monitoring and diagnosis based on acoustic emission and hidden semi-Markov model,","Machine condition monitoring is considered as an important diagnostic and maintenance strategy to ensure product quality and reduce manufacturing cost. However, currently, most additive manufacturing (AM) machines are not equipped with sensors for system monitoring. In this paper, a real-time lightweight AM machine condition monitoring approach is proposed, where acoustic emission (AE) sensor is used. In the proposed method, the original AE waveform signals are first simplified as AE hits, and then segmental and principal component analyses are applied to further reduce the data size and computational cost. From AE hits, the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is applied to identify the machine states, including both normal and abnormal ones. Experimental studies on fused deposition modeling (FDM), one of the most popular AM technology, show that the typical machine failures can be identified in a real-time manner. This monitoring method can serve as a diagnostic tool for FDM machines.",
57,"Autonomous in-situ correction of fused deposition modeling printers using computer vision and deep learning,","Fused deposition modeling, a widely used additive manufacturing process, currently faces challenges in printed part quality such as under-extrusion and over-extrusion. In this paper, a real-time monitoring and autonomous correction system is developed, where a deep learning model and a feedback loop is used to modify 3D-printing parameters iteratively and adaptively. Results show that our system is capable of detecting in-plane printing conditions and in-situ correct defects faster than the speed of a human’s response. The fundamental elements in the framework proposed can be extended to various 3D-printing technologies to reliably fabricate high-performance materials in challenging environments without human interaction.",
58,Development of data-driven in-situ monitoring and diagnosis system of fused deposition modeling (FDM) process based on support vector machine algorithm,"Fused deposition modeling (FDM), one of representative additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, has been widely used for fabricating functional parts with geometrical complexity. However, it has suffered from degraded part quality and low process reliability and controllability. Therefore, it is of much significance to develop a monitoring and diagnosis system for the FDM process to overcome such drawbacks. In this paper, a data-driven FDM process monitoring and diagnosis system is developed by using two types of sensors – an accelerometer and an acoustic emission (AE) sensor. A large number of experimental data, collected from the accelerometers and AE sensor under healthy and faulty process states, are processed to obtain a critical feature – a root mean square (RMS). The RMS values are then used for training the FDM process monitoring and diagnosis models based on a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and a k-fold cross validation approach. In particular, the SVM-based models for the odd- and evennumbered layers of one FDM specimen are developed. For a real-time validation in a factory floor, the non-linear SVM-based models using the acceleration signals are used for the software development. The diagnosis accuracy is better than 87.5%, and an applicability of the models is verified.",
59,Machine learning in tolerancing for additive manufacturing,"Design for additive manufacturing has gained extensive research attention in recent years, whereas tolerancing issues aiming at controlling geometric variations remain a major bottleneck in achieving predictive models and realistic simulations. In this paper, a prescriptive deviation modelling method coupled with machine learning techniques is proposed to address the modelling of shape deviations in additive manufacturing. The in-plane geometric deviations are mapped into an established deviation space and Bayesian inference is used to estimate geometric deviations patterns by statistical learning from multiple shapes data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated and discussed through illustrative case studies.",
60,Achieving better connections between deposited lines in additive manufacturing via machine learning,"Additive manufacturing is becoming increasingly popular because of its unique advantages, especially fused deposition modelling (FDM) which has been widely used due to its simplicity and comparatively low price. All the process parameters of FDM can be changed to achieve different goals. For example, lower print speed may lead to higher strength of the fabricated parts. While changing these parameters (eg print speed, layer height, filament extrusion speed and path distance in a layer), the connection between paths (lines) in a layer will be changed. To achieve the best connection among paths in a real printing process, how these parameters may result in what kind of connection should be studied. In this paper, a machine learning (deep neural network) model is proposed to predict the connection between paths in different process parameters. Four hundred experiments were conducted on an FDM machine to obtain the corresponding connection status data. Among them, there are 280 groups of data that were used to train the machine learning model, while the rest 120 groups of data were used for testing. The results show that this machine learning model can predict the connection status with the accuracy of around 83%. In the future, this model can be used to select the best process parameters in additive manufacturing processes with corresponding objectives.",
61,Physics-informed and hybrid machine learning in additive manufacturing: application to fused filament fabrication,"This article investigates several physics-informed and hybrid machine learning strategies that incorporate physics knowledge in experimental data-driven deep-learning models for predicting the bond quality and porosity of fused filament fabrication (FFF) parts. Three types of strategies are explored to incorporate physics constraints and multi-physics FFF simulation results into a deep neural network (DNN), thus ensuring consistency with physical laws: (1) incorporate physics constraints within the loss function of the DNN, (2) use physics model outputs as additional inputs to the DNN model, and (3) pre-train a DNN model with physics model input-output and then update it with experimental data. These strategies help to enforce a physically consistent relationship between bond quality and tensile strength, thus making porosity predictions physically meaningful. Eight different combinations of the above strategies are investigated. The results show how the combination of multiple strategies produces accurate machine learning models even with limited experimental data.",
62,Real-time defect detection in 3D printing using machine learning,"3D printing or additive manufacturing is one of the key aspects of industry 4.0. However, 3D printing technology has its vulnerabilities due to the defects that develop for various reasons. This project focuses to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Deep Learning model to detect real-time malicious defects to prevent the production losses and reduce human involvement for quality checks. The method proposed here is based on feature extraction of geometrical anomalies occurring in infill patterns due to inconsistent extrusion, weak infills, lack of supports, or sagging and compare it to the features of a perfect 3D print. This approach is built on the concepts of image classification and computer vision using machine learning, which is an extremely popular technology because of the availability of datasets, monitoring systems, and the ability to detect causal relationships of defects. To check the quality of the parts, an integrated camera with the 3D printer captures images at regular intervals and process it using the CNN model. The results of this project are a more optimized and automated 3D printing process with the potential to solve the most widespread problem of product variability in 3D printing.",
63,Automated detection of part quality during two-photon lithography via deep learning,"Two-photon lithography (TPL) is an additive manufacturing technique for fabricating three-dimensional objects with nanoscale features. A main challenge of TPL is the routine and labor-intensive task of finding suitable light dosage parameters, i.e. writing speed and laser intensity that induce photo-polymerization within a wide variety of candidate photo-curing polymers. Another challenge is the monitoring required during fabrication. In this work, we apply machine learning (ML) models to accelerate the process of identifying optimal light dosage parameters and automate the detection of part quality. We curate TPL videos of different parts fabricated under a range of light dosage parameters using different resins and train spatial-temporal ML models on this data. Our results show that ML models can detect TPL part quality with a 95.1% accuracy in milliseconds. We also evaluate classification failures and identify two operating modes: parameter optimization and part quality detection. Last but not least, we publicly release this labelled dataset so that it may serve as a useful benchmark to the community. Our approach to process optimization and part quality detection addresses important aspects of TPL industrialization, is applicable beyond TPL and should benefit other additive manufacturing techniques with similar barriers to operating at industrial scale.",
64,Data-driven microstructure and microhardness design in additive manufacturing using a self-organizing map,"To design microstructure and microhardness in the additive manufacturing (AM) of nickel (Ni)-based superalloys, the present work develops a novel data-driven approach that combines physics-based models, experimental measurements, and a data-mining method. The simulation is based on a computational thermal-fluid dynamics (CtFD) model, which can obtain thermal behavior, solidification parameters such as cooling rate, and the dilution of solidified clad. Based on the computed thermal information, dendrite arm spacing and microhardness are estimated using well-tested mechanistic models. Experimental microstructure and microhardness are determined and compared with the simulated values for validation. To visualize process–structure–properties (PSPs) linkages, the simulation and experimental datasets are input to a data-mining model—a self-organizing map (SOM). The design windows of the process parameters under multiple objectives can be obtained from the visualized maps. The proposed approaches can be utilized in AM and other data-intensive processes. Data-driven linkages between process, structure, and properties have the potential to benefit online process monitoring control in order to derive an ideal microstructure and mechanical properties.",
65,Deep learning-based tensile strength prediction in fused deposition modeling,"As one of the transformative technologies, Additive Manufacturing (AM) has been facing the challenge of product property inconsistency, which prevents its adoption in various critical applications. Various studies have been dedicated to building the predictive models for improved AM quality control. However, the distinct layer-by-layer printing process and the related cyclic layer thermal history present significant difficulty in model accuracy and reliability. This paper presents a data-driven predictive model by taking into account the printing process in a deep learning network structure, using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) as a representative case study. Temperature and vibration data are measured to reveal the layer-wise thermal and mechanical activities as well as the process variation, and the inter-relationship among different printing layers is characterized by a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network. The sensing data, combined with process parameters and material property, are then fused for predicting the tensile strength of manufactured parts. To quantify the influence of each process parameters on the prediction result, a modified Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is investigated. Experimental evaluation has shown that the LSTM-based predictive model outperforms several machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Regression and Random Forest. The relevance distribution revealed by LRP is found useful for interpreting the prediction result.",
66, Efficient numerical modeling of 3D-printed lattice-cell structures using neural networks,"Additively manufactured structures can be tailor-made to optimally distribute mechanical loads while remaining light-weight. To efficiently analyze the locally unique mechanical behavior of structures made from a large number of small lattice cells, a strategy which employs neural networks and deep learning to predict the maximum stresses in the realm of linear elasto-plasticity of a detail-level finite-element model is presented. The strategy is demonstrated on a single lattice cell specimen. Good agreements between experimental, finite element and neural network results are found at a significant reduction in computation time.",
67,Application of machine learning techniques to predict the mechanical properties of polyamide 2200 (PA12) in additive manufacturing,"Additive manufacturing (AM) is an attractive technology for the manufacturing industry due to flexibility in its design and functionality, but inconsistency in quality is one of the major limitations preventing utilizing this technology for the production of end-use parts. The prediction of mechanical properties can be one of the possible ways to improve the repeatability of results. The part placement, part orientation, and STL model properties (number of mesh triangles, surface, and volume) are used to predict tensile modulus, nominal stress, and elongation at break for polyamide 2200 (also known as PA12). An EOS P395 polymer powder bed fusion system was used to fabricate 217 specimens in two identical builds (434 specimens in total). Prediction is performed for XYZ, XZY, ZYX, and Angle orientations separately, and all orientations together. The different non-linear models based on machine learning methods have higher prediction accuracy compared with linear regression models. Linear regression models only have prediction accuracy higher than 80% for Tensile Modulus and Elongation at break in Angle orientation. Since orientation-based modeling has low prediction accuracy due to a small number of data points and lack of information about the material properties, these models need to be improved in the future based on additional experimental work.",
68,Achieving better connections between deposited lines in additive manufacturing via machine learning,"Additive manufacturing is becoming increasingly popular because of its unique advantages, especially fused deposition modelling (FDM) which has been widely used due to its simplicity and comparatively low price. All the process parameters of FDM can be changed to achieve different goals. For example, lower print speed may lead to higher strength of the fabricated parts. While changing these parameters (eg print speed, layer height, filament extrusion speed and path distance in a layer), the connection between paths (lines) in a layer will be changed. To achieve the best connection among paths in a real printing process, how these parameters may result in what kind of connection should be studied. In this paper, a machine learning (deep neural network) model is proposed to predict the connection between paths in different process parameters. Four hundred experiments were conducted on an FDM machine to obtain the corresponding connection status data. Among them, there are 280 groups of data that were used to train the machine learning model, while the rest 120 groups of data were used for testing. The results show that this machine learning model can predict the connection status with the accuracy of around 83%. In the future, this model can be used to select the best process parameters in additive manufacturing processes with corresponding objectives.",
69,Layerwise anomaly detection in laser powder-bed fusion metal additive manufacturing,"A growing research trend in additive manufacturing (AM) calls for layerwise anomaly detection as a step toward enabling real-time process control, in contrast to ex situ or postprocess testing and characterization. We propose a method for layerwise anomaly detection during laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) metal AM. The method uses high-speed thermal imaging to capture melt pool temperature and is composed of the following four-step anomaly detection procedure: (1) using the captured thermal images, a process signature of a just-fabricated layer is generated. Next, a signature difference is obtained by subtracting the process signature of that particular layer from a prespecified reference signature, (2) a screening step selects potential regions of interests (ROIs) within the layer that are likely to contain process anomalies, hence reducing the computational burden associated with analyzing the full layer data, (3) the spatial dependence of these ROIs is modeled using a Gaussian process model, and then pixels with statistically significant deviations are flagged, and (4) using the quantity and the spatial pattern of the flagged pixels as predictors, a classifier is trained and implemented to determine whether the process is in- or out-of-control. We validate the proposed method using a case study on a commercial L-PBF system custom-instrumented with a dual-wavelength imaging pyrometer for capturing the thermal images during fabrication.",
70,Porosity prediction: Supervised-learning of thermal history for direct laser deposition,"The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the melt pool characteristics and the defect occurrence in an as-built additive manufacturing part. One of the major detrimental microstructure properties associated with additive manufacturing (AM) is porosity within final parts. State-of-the-art porosity detection methods focus primarily on post-manufacturing approaches that are susceptible to high cost of process, longer process time, and are incapable of characterizing pores during fabrication. A real-time porosity prediction method is developed using morphological characteristics of the melt pool boundary (i.e., features obtained via functional principal component analysis (FPCA)). A thermal monitoring system is used to capture the time-varying melt pool signal, which are labeled as either pores or normal melt pools by X-ray tomography. Supervised learning methods are utilized to identify the patterns of melt pool images and build a black-box model for the probability distribution of class labels (namely, porosity) based on data characteristics of predictors (e.g., melt pool characteristics). The resultant model does not depend on specific design of specimens with varying material properties; and can be effectively developed as long as thermal-porosity data can be obtained. In the current study, multiple supervised machine learning approaches are used to classify melt pools to predict porosity in a part. Two different accuracy measures are used and numerical experiments show that among the classification approaches used (i.e., Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)), KNN results in the highest rate of accurately classifying melt pools (98.44%). However, DT results in the lowest rate for incorrectly identifying normal melt pools as pores (0.03%). A comparative study is conducted that compares the performance of supervised learning methods leveraging the proposed morphological model and simple metrics of the melt pool. Numerical experiments show that the morphological model combined with supervised learning techniques vastly outperform the simple melt pool metrics combined with supervised learning techniques (approximately 250% better performance for correctly predicting abnormal melt pools). Our approach may potentially be applied to other AM processes that share similar energy-material interactions (e.g., powder bed fusion, electron beam melting).",
71,Layer-wise modeling and anomaly detection for laser-based additive manufacturing,"Additive manufacturing (AM) is a novel fabrication technique capable of producing highly complex parts. Nevertheless, a major challenge is the quality assurance of the AM fabricated parts. While there are several ways of approaching this problem, how to develop informative process signatures to detect part anomalies for quality control is still an open question. The objective of this study is to build a new layer-wise process signature model to characterize the thermal-defect relationship. Based on melt pool images, we propose novel layer-wise key process signatures, which are calculated using multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) and are directly correlated with the layer-wise quality of the part. The resultant layer-wise quality features can be used to predict the overall defect distribution of a fabricated layer during the build. The proposed model is validated through a case study based on a direct laser deposition experiment, where the layer-wise quality of the part is predicted on the fly. The accuracy of prediction is calculated using three measures (i.e., recall, precision, and F-score), showing reasonable success of the proposed methodology in predicting layer-wise quality. The proposed quality prediction methodology enables online process correction to eliminate anomalies and to ultimately improve the quality of the fabricated parts.",
72,Heterogeneous sensing and scientific machine learning for quality assurance in laser powder bed fusion–a single-track study,"Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is the predominant metal additive manufacturing technique that benefits from a significant body of academic study and industrial investment given its ability to create complex geometry parts. Despite LPBF’s widespread use, there still exists a need for process monitoring to ensure reliable part production and reduce post-build quality assessments. Towards this end, we develop and evaluate machine learning-based predictive models using height map-derived quality metrics for single tracks and the accompanying pyrometer and high-speed video camera data collected under a wide range of laser power and laser velocity settings. We extract physically intuitive low-level features representative of the meltpool dynamics from these sensing modalities and explore how these vary with the linear energy density. We find our Sequential Decision Analysis Neural Network (SeDANN) model – a scientific machine learning model that incorporates physical process insights – outperforms other purely data-driven black box models in both accuracy and speed. The general approach to data curation and adaptable nature of SeDANN’s scientifically informed architecture should benefit LPBF systems with an evolving suite of sensing modalities and post-build quality measurements.",
73, Defect classification of laser metal deposition using logistic regression and artificial neural networks for pattern recognition,"Detecting laser metal deposition (LMD) defects is a key element of evaluating the probability of failure of the produced part. Acoustic emission (AE) is an effective technique in LMD defect detection. This work presents a systematic experimental investigation of using AE technique for detecting and classifying different defects in LMD. The defects generated during LMD simulate AE sources on deposited material while the AE sensor was mounted on the substrate to capture AE signals. An experiment was conducted to investigate the ability of AE to detect and identify defects generated during LMD using a logistic regression (LM) model and an artificial neural network (ANN). AE features, such as peak amplitude, rise time, duration, energy, and number of counts along with statistical features were extracted and analyzed. Additionally, frequency analysis using fast Fourier transformation was conducted on the AE signal. The results show that AE has considerable potential in LMD monitoring for assessing the overall deposition quality and identifying defects that can significantly reduce the strength and reliability of deposited material, and consequently, increase the risk of a component’s failure.",
74,Metal additive manufacturing parts inspection using convolutional neural network,"Metal additive manufacturing (AM) is gaining increasing attention from academia and industry due to its unique advantages compared to the traditional manufacturing process. Parts quality inspection is playing a crucial role in the AM industry, which can be adopted for product improvement. However, the traditional inspection process has relied on manual recognition, which could suffer from low efficiency and potential bias. This study presented a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach toward robust AM quality inspection, such as good quality, crack, gas porosity, and lack of fusion. To obtain the appropriate model, experiments were performed on a series of architectures. Moreover, data augmentation was adopted to deal with data scarcity. L2 regularization (weight decay) and dropout were applied to avoid overfitting. The impact of each strategy was evaluated. The final CNN model achieved an accuracy of 92.1%, and it took 8.01 milliseconds to recognize one image. The CNN model presented here can help in automatic defect recognition in the AM industry.",
75,In-process monitoring of porosity during laser additive manufacturing process,"This paper describes a deep-learning-based method for porosity monitoring in laser additive manufacturing process. A high-speed digital camera was mounted coaxially to the process laser beam for in-process sensing of melt-pool data, and convolutional neural network models were designed to learn melt-pool features to predict the porosity attributes in deposited specimens during laser additive manufacturing. With the image processing tools developed in this paper, the extraction of porosity information from raw quality inspection data, such as cross-section images and tomography data sets, can be automated. The CNN models with a compact architecture, part of whose hyperparameters were selected through cross-validation analysis, achieved a classification accuracy of 91.2% for porosity occurrence detection in the direct laser deposition of sponge Titanium powders and presented predictive capacity for micro pores below 100 μm. For local volume porosity prediction, the model also achieved a root mean square error of 1.32% and exhibited high fidelity for both high porosity and low porosity specimens.",
76,A physics-driven deep learning model for process-porosity causal relationship and porosity prediction with interpretability in laser metal deposition,"Porosity produced in laser metal deposition hampers its application due to the absence of an effective prediction method. Measured thermal images of the melt pool provide a unique opportunity for porosity analytics. Furthermore, a physical model may provide complementary rich data that cannot be measured otherwise. How to leverage both types of data to predict porosity is very challenging. This paper presents a physics-driven deep learning model to predict porosity by integrating both measured and predicted data of the melt pool. The model fidelity is validated with the predicted pore occurrence and size with enhanced interpretability of Ti–6Al–4V thin-wall structures.",
77,Deep Learning for Distortion Prediction in Laser-Based Additive Manufacturing using Big Data,"Laser-Based Additive Manufacturing (LBAM) is a fabrication process that is a key aspect of Industry 4.0, which aims to employ many sensors for continuous process control. One current challenge in LBAM is the geometric inaccuracy of fabricated parts. To increase accuracy, accurate predictions of distortion are needed. Here we develop a novel Deep Learning approach that accurately predicts distortion well within LBAM tolerance limits by considering the local heat transfer for pointwise distortion prediction. Our Deep Learning approach not only gives highly accurate predictions but also fits into the Industry 4.0 framework of analyzing big data with many sensors.",
78,Deep learning-based data fusion method for in situ porosity detection in laser-based additive manufacturing,"Laser-based additive manufacturing (LBAM) provides unrivalled design freedom with the ability to manufacture complicated parts for a wide range of engineering applications. Melt pool is one of the most important signatures in LBAM and is indicative of process anomalies and part defects. High-speed thermal images of the melt pool captured during LBAM make it possible for in situ melt pool monitoring and porosity prediction. This paper aims to broaden current knowledge of the underlying relationship between process and porosity in LBAM and provide new possibilities for efficient and accurate porosity prediction. We present a deep learning-based data fusion method to predict porosity in LBAM parts by leveraging the measured melt pool thermal history and two newly created deep learning neural networks. A PyroNet, based on Convolutional Neural Networks, is developed to correlate in-process pyrometry images with layer-wise porosity; an IRNet, based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks, is developed to correlate sequential thermal images from an infrared camera with layer-wise porosity. Predictions from PyroNet and IRNet are fused at the decision-level to obtain a more accurate prediction of layer-wise porosity. The model fidelity is validated with LBAM Ti–6Al–4V thin-wall structure. This is the first work that manages to fuse pyrometer data and infrared camera data for metal additive manufacturing (AM). The case study results based on benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve high accuracy with relatively high efficiency, demonstrating the applicability of the method for in situ porosity detection in LBAM.",
79,In situ monitoring of selective laser melting of zinc powder via infrared imaging of the process plume,"Despite continuous technological improvements in metal additive manufacturing (AM) systems, process stability is still affected by several possible sources of defects especially in the presence of challenging materials. Thus, both the research community and the major AM system developers have focused an increasing attention on in situ sensing and monitoring tools in the last years. However, there is still a lack of statistical methods to automatically detect the onset of a defect and signal an alarm during the part's layer-wise production. This study contributes to this framework with two levels of novelty. First, it presents an in situ monitoring method that integrates the acquisition of infrared images with a data mining approach for feature extraction and a statistical process monitoring technique to design a data-driven and automated alarm rule. Second, the method is aimed at monitoring powder bed fusion processes for difficult-to-process materials like zinc and its alloys, which impose several challenges to the process stability and quality because of their low melting and boiling points. To this aim, the proposed approach analyzes the byproducts generated by the interaction between the energy source and the material. In particular, it detects unstable behaviors by analyzing the salient properties of the process plume to detect unstable melting conditions. This case study entails an SLM process on zinc powder, where different sets of process parameters were tested leading either to in-control or out-of-control quality conditions. A comparison analysis highlights the effectiveness of plume-based stability monitoring.",
80,"Extraction and evaluation of melt pool, plume and spatter information for powder-bed fusion AM process monitoring","With the continuous development of additive manufacturing technique, the issue on built quality has caught increasing attentions. To improve the quality of built parts, the process monitoring and control has been emphasized as a promising solution. Despite a large number of studies on the development of sensors and instrumentations, the investigation on statistical analysis, modelling and automatic anomalies detection is still at an infant stage. To advance the related research, the intelligent classification methods, support vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), were proposed for quality level identification in this work. A vision system with high speed camera was used for process images acquisition. The features of different objects including melt pool, plume and spatter were extracted based on the AM process understanding. The corresponding feature vectors were used as the input for the SVM classification. The results indicated the information from different objects is sensitive to different types of quality anomalies. Moreover, the combination of features from these three objects can significantly improve the classification accuracy to 90.1%. Additionally, the comparison between SVM and CNN was also conducted, the high accuracy of 92.7% for the CNN model demonstrated that it is a promising method for quality level identification by using the vision system.",
81, Application of supervised machine learning for defect detection during metallic powder bed fusion additive manufacturing using high resolution imaging,"Process monitoring in additive manufacturing (AM) is a crucial component in the mission of broadening AM industrialization. However, conventional part evaluation and qualification techniques, such as computed tomography (CT), can only be utilized after the build is complete, and thus eliminate any potential to correct defects during the build process. In contrast to post-build CT, in situ defect detection based on in situ sensing, such as layerwise visual inspection, enables the potential for in-process re-melting and correction of detected defects and thus facilitates in-process part qualification. This paper describes the development and implementation of such an in situ defect detection strategy for powder bed fusion (PBF) AM using supervised machine learning. During the build process, multiple images were collected at each build layer using a high resolution digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera. For each neighborhood in the resulting layerwise image stack, multi-dimensional visual features were extracted and evaluated using binary classification techniques, i.e. a linear support vector machine (SVM). Through binary classification, neighborhoods are then categorized as either a flaw, i.e. an undesirable interruption in the typical structure of the material, or a nominal build condition. Ground truth labels, i.e. the true location of flaws and nominal build areas, which are needed to train the binary classifiers, were obtained from post-build high-resolution 3D CT scan data. In CT scans, discontinuities, e.g. incomplete fusion, porosity, cracks, or inclusions, were identified using automated analysis tools or manual inspection. The xyz locations of the CT data were transferred into the layerwise image domain using an affine transformation, which was estimated using reference points embedded in the part. After the classifier had been properly trained, in situ defect detection accuracies greater than 80% were demonstrated during cross-validation experiments.",
82, An online surface defects detection system for AWAM based on deep learning,"Defects detecting layer by layer in arc welding based additive manufacturing (AWAM) is a big challenge as it affects the successive layer quality of the products. Most of the work on layer quality defection were focused on 3D profile measurement and X-ray spectroscopy method but it is inefficient, expensive with poor adaptability. In this work, an online intelligent surface defects detection system for AWAM was developed through deep learning algorithm and support vector machine method. To achieve a reliable surface feature of the welding beads, a vision sensor was used to get the image of the shaped surface synchronously. The system was trained offline and online to acquire knowledge of the welding beads which were classified into five patterns as normal, pore, hump, depression and undercut. An defection test result showed 95.29% accuracy. The system was verified to be practical with high accuracy and efficiency for the surface defects.",
83,Adaptive control of deposited height in GMAW-based layer additive manufacturing,"A passive vision sensor system has been developed to monitor the nozzle to the top surface distance (NTSD) in layer additive manufacturing (LAM) using gas metal arc welding (GMAW). The deviations in the NTSD are compensated by the movement of the working flat, and the adjustment of the deposition rate on next deposition layer. After simplification of the controlled process into a linear system, an adaptive control system has been designed to keep the NTSD constant. The effectiveness of the controller is evaluated through deposition of single-bead multi-layer walls, and the experimental results confirm that the process stability can be improved when applying the developed controller.",
84,Closed-loop control of variable layer width for thin- walled parts in wire and arc additive manufacturing,"An intelligent single-neuron self-adjusting controller is proposed for variable layer width control in wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The travel speed is selected as the input control variable and the layer width is chosen as the output. The performance of the controller is validated by the disturbance of deposition current, inter-layer temperature, and given layer width. It is also evaluated through deposition of a 13-layered wall with variable layer width. The proposed controller is effective for increasing the process stability when the expected layer width ranges from 6 to 9 mm.",
85,"Extraction and evaluation of melt pool, plume and spatter information for powder-bed fusion AM process monitoring","With the continuous development of additive manufacturing technique, the issue on built quality has caught increasing attentions.

86,Sensor-based build condition monitoring in laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process using a spectral graph theoretic approach,"The goal of this work is to monitor the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process using an array of sensors so that a record may be made of those temporal and spatial build locations where there is a high probability of defect formation. In pursuit of this goal, a commercial LPBF machine at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was integrated with three types of sensors, namely, a photodetector, high-speed visible camera, and short wave infrared (SWIR) thermal camera with the following objectives: (1) to develop and apply a spectral graph theoretic approach to monitor the LPBF build condition from the data acquired by the three sensors; (2) to compare results from the three different sensors in terms of their statistical fidelity in distinguishing between different build conditions. The first objective will lead to early identification of incipient defects from in-process sensor data. The second objective will ascertain the monitoring fidelity tradeoff involved in replacing an expensive sensor, such as a thermal camera, with a relatively inexpensive, low resolution sensor, e.g., a photodetector. As a first-step toward detection of defects and process irregularities that occur in practical LPBF scenarios, this work focuses on capturing and differentiating the distinctive thermal signatures that manifest in parts with overhang features. Overhang features can significantly decrease the ability of laser heat to diffuse from the heat source. This constrained heat flux may lead to issues such as poor surface finish, distortion, and microstructure inhomogeneity. In this work, experimental sensor data are acquired during LPBF of a simple test part having an overhang angle of 40.5 deg. Extracting and detecting the difference in sensor signatures for such a simple case is the first-step toward in situ defect detection in additive manufacturing (AM). The proposed approach uses the Eigen spectrum of the spectral graph Laplacian matrix as a derived signature from the three different sensors to discriminate the thermal history of overhang features from that of the bulk areas of the part. The statistical accuracy for isolating the thermal patterns belonging to bulk and overhang features in terms of the F-score is as follows: (a) F-score of 95% from the SWIR thermal camera signatures; (b) 83% with the high-speed visible camera; (c) 79% with the photodetector. In comparison, conventional signal analysis techniques—e.g., neural networks, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis were evaluated with F-score in the range of 40–60%.",
87,A deep neural network for classification of melt-pool images in metal additive manufacturing,"By applying a deep neural network to selective laser melting, we studied a classification model of melt-pool images with respect to 6 laser power labels. Laser power influenced to form pores or cracks determining the part quality and was positively-linearly dependent to the density of the part. Using the neural network of which the number of nodes is dropped with increasing the layer number achieved satisfactory inference when melt-pool images had blurred edges. The proposed neural network showed the classification failure rate under 1.1% for 13,200 test images and was more effective to monitor melt-pool images because it simultaneously handled various shapes, comparing with a simple calculation such as the sum of pixel intensity in melt-pool images. The classification model could be utilized to infer the location to cause the unexpected alteration of microstructures or separate the defective products non-destructively.",
88," From in-situ monitoring toward high-throughput process control: cost-driven decision-making framework for laser-based additive manufacturing,","Additive manufactured (AM) parts are subject to low repeatability compared to their traditional counterparts. The complex Process-Structure-Property relationship that governs the laser-based AM processes calls for advanced analytics approaches for quality control. Tremendous efforts have been dedicated to the in-situ monitoring of AM processes by leveraging the thermal history during fabrication. Melt pool image is regarded as one of the most informative process signatures for real-time porosity detection. Attempting to control/correct all microstructure defects during the AM fabrication may significantly reduce the process throughput, which has been a bottleneck of the AM technology for its wider industrial adoption. Without distinguishing different types of defects from one another, and without formally characterizing the cost/impact of microstructural defects on part property, an efficient in-process control strategy cannot be obtained. In this paper, a cost-driven decision-making framework is proposed to formulate costs of the spatial distribution of microstructural defects and the corresponding control actions, based on in-situ melt pool images. A case study based on thin wall fabrication using a Laser Engineered Net Shaping process is used to illustrate the effectiveness in both classification accuracy and misclassification cost. This work is expected to lay a theoretical foundation for the development of an efficient in-process control strategy, which aims to improve the mechanical properties of fabricated part while maintaining high process throughput.",
89,Detecting cyber-physical attacks in CyberManufacturing systems with machine learning methods,"CyberManufacturing system (CMS) is a vision for future manufacturing systems. The concept delineates a vision of advanced manufacturing system integrated with technologies such as Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Sensors Network and Machine Learning. As a result, cyber-attacks such as Stuxnet attack will increase along with growing simultaneous connectivity. Now, cyber-physical attacks are new and unique risks to CMSs and modern cyber security countermeasure is not enough. To learn this new vulnerability, the cyber-physical attacks is defined via a taxonomy under the vision of CMS. Machine learning on physical data is studied for detecting cyber-physical attacks. Two examples were developed with simulation and experiments: 3D printing malicious attack and CNC milling machine malicious attack. By implementing machine learning methods in physical data, the anomaly detection algorithm reached 96.1% accuracy in detecting cyber-physical attacks in 3D printing process; random forest algorithm reached on average 91.1% accuracy in detecting cyber-physical attacks in CNC milling process.",
90,High cycle fatigue life prediction of laser additive manufactured stainless steel: a machine learning approach,"Variations in the high cycle fatigue response of laser powder bed fusion materials can be caused by the choice of processing and post-processing strategies. The numerous influencing factors arising from the process demand an effective and unified approach to fatigue property assessment. This work examines the use of a neuro-fuzzy-based machine learning method for predicting the high cycle fatigue life of laser powder bed fusion stainless steel 316L. A dataset, consisting of fatigue life data for samples subjected to varying processing conditions (laser power, scan speed and layer thickness), post-processing treatments (annealing and hot isostatic pressing) and cyclic stresses, was constructed for simulating a complex nonlinear input-output environment. The associated fracture mechanisms, including the modes of crack initiation and deformation, were characterised. Two models, by employing the processing/post-processing parameters and the static tensile properties respectively as the inputs, were developed from the training data. Despite the diverse fatigue and fracture properties, the models demonstrated good prediction accuracy when checked against the test data, and the computationally-derived fuzzy rules agree well with understanding of the fracture mechanisms. Direct application of the model to literature results, however, yielded a range of prediction accuracies because of the variability in the reported data. Retraining the model by incorporating the literature results into the dataset led to improved modelling performance.",
91,Modelling of direct metal laser sintering of EOS DM20 bronze using neural networks and genetic algorithms,"An attempt was made to predict the density and microhardness of a component produced by Laser Sintering of EOS DM20 Bronze material for a given set of process parameters. Neural networks were used for process-based-modelling, and results compared with a Taguchi analysis. Samples were produced using a powder-bed type ALM (Additive Layer Manufacturing)-system, with laser power, scan speed and hatch distance as the input parameters, with values equally spaced according to a factorial design of experiments. Optical Microscopy was used to measure cross-sectional porosity of samples; Micro-indentation to measure the corresponding Vickers’ hardness. Two different designs of neural networks were used-Counter Propagation (CPNN) and Feed-Forward Back-Propagation (BPNN) and their prediction capabilities were compared. For BPNN network, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) was later applied to enhance the prediction accuracy by altering its topology. Using neural network toolbox in MATLAB, BPNN was trained using 12 training algorithms. The most effective MATLAB training algorithm and the effect of GA-based optimization on the prediction capability of neural networks were both identified.",
92,"Prediction of porosity in metal-based additive manufacturing using spatial Gaussian process models,","Additive manufacturing (AM) is a set of emerging technologies that can produce physical objects with complex geometrical shapes directly from a digital model. With many unique capabilities, such as design freedom, it has recently gained increasing attention from researchers, practitioners, and public media. However, achieving the full potential of AM is hampered by many challenges, including the lack of predictive models that correlate processing parameters with the properties of the processed part. We develop a Gaussian process-based predictive model for the learning and prediction of the porosity in metallic parts produced using selective laser melting (SLM – a laser-based AM process). More specifically, a spatial Gaussian process regression model is first developed to model part porosity as a function of SLM process parameters. Next, a Bayesian inference framework is used to estimate the statistical model parameters, and the porosity of the part at any given setting is predicted using the Kriging method. A case study is conducted to validate this predictive framework through predicting the porosity of 17-4 PH stainless steel manufacturing on a ProX 100 selective laser melting system.",
93, Gaussian process- based surrogate modeling framework for process planning in laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing of 316L stainless steel,"Laser Powder-Bed Fusion (L-PBF) metal-based additive manufacturing (AM) is complex and not fully understood. Successful processing for one material, might not necessarily apply to a different material. This paper describes a workflow process that aims at creating a material data sheet standard that describes regimes where the process can be expected to be robust. The procedure consists of building a Gaussian process-based surrogate model of the L-PBF process that predicts melt pool depth in single-track experiments given a laser power, scan speed, and laser beam size combination. The predictions are then mapped onto a power versus scan speed diagram delimiting the conduction from the keyhole melting controlled regimes. This statistical framework is shown to be robust even for cases where experimental training data might be suboptimal in quality, if appropriate physics-based filters are applied. Additionally, it is demonstrated that a high-fidelity simulation model of L-PBF can equally be successfully used for building a surrogate model, which is beneficial since simulations are getting more efficient and are more practical to study the response of different materials, than to re-tool an AM machine for new material powder.",
94,Machine learning enabled powder spreading process map for metal additive manufacturing (AM),"The metal powder-bed AM process involves two main steps: the spreading of powder layer and selective fusing or binding the spread layer. Most AM research is focused on powder fusion. Powder spreading is more rarely studied but is of significant importance for considering the quality of the final part and total build time. It is thus essential to understand how to modify the spread parameters such as spreader speed, to generate layers with desirable roughness and porosity. A computational modeling framework employing Discrete Element Method (DEM) is applied to simulate the spreading process, which is difficult to study experimentally, of Ti-6Al-4V powder onto smooth substrates. Since the DEM simulations are computationally expensive, machine learning was employed to interpolate between the highly non-linear results obtained by the running a few DEM simulations. Eventually, a spreading process map is generated to determine which spreader parameters can achieve the desired surface roughness and spread speed. This eventually saves the total time for printing and reduces the cost of build.",
95,"Simple method to construct process maps for additive manufacturing using a support vector machine,","We propose a simple method to construct a process map for additive manufacturing using a support vector machine. By observing the surface of the built parts and classifying them into two classes (good or bad), this method enables a process map to be constructed in order to predict a process condition that is effective at fabricating a part with low pore density. This proposed method is demonstrated in a biomedical CoCr alloy system. We show that the proposed method is effective at reducing the number of experiments necessary to tailor an optimized process condition. This study also shows that the value of a decision function in a support vector machine has a physical meaning (at least in the proposed method) and is a semi-quantitative guideline for porosity density of parts fabricated by additive manufacturing.",
96,"An example of machine learning applied in additive manufacturing, 2018 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM)","Artificial Intelligence has become ubiquitous in many application sectors nowadays. One field, machine learning, has proved to be promising for industries as it can solve complex problems thanks to various methods and algorithms. The present article is an example of machine learning with EBM, a recent additive manufacturing technology. Several algorithms are tested onto the manufacturing of a part in order to check which results can extrapolate at the best the deformation risks vs the quality of the part to build. In this example, a few parameters of support structures are identified and are varied to observe the algorithms validity.",
97,"Measurement of environmental aspect of 3-D printing process using soft computing methods,","For improving the environmental performance of the manufacturing industry across the globe, 3-D printing technology should be increasingly adopted as a manufacturing procedure. It is because this technology uses the polymer PLA (Polyactic acid) as a material, which is biodegradable, and saves fuel and reduces waste when fabricating prototypes. In addition, the technology can be located near to industries and fabricates raw material itself, resulting in reduction of transport costs and carbon emission. However, due to its high production cost, 3-D printing technology is not yet being adopted globally. One way of reducing the production cost and improving environmental performance is to formulate models that can be used to operate 3-D printing technology in an efficient way. Therefore, this paper aims to deploy the soft computing methods such as genetic programming (GP), support vector regression and artificial neural network in formulating the laser power-based-open porosity models. These methods are applied on the selective laser sintering (a 3-D printing process) process data. It is found that GP evolves the best model that is able to predict open porosity satisfactorily based on given values of laser power. The laser power-based-open porosity model formulated can assist decision makers in operating the SLS process in an effective and efficient way, thus increasing its viability for being adopted as a manufacturing procedure and paving the way for a sustainable environment across the globe.",
98,A new computational intelligence approach in formulation of functional relationship of open porosity of the additive manufacturing process,"An additive manufacturing process of selective laser sintering (SLS) builds components of complex 3D shapes directly from metal powder. Past studies reveal that the properties of an SLS-fabricated prototype such as porosity, surface roughness, waviness, compressive strength, tensile strength, wear strength, and dimensional accuracy depend on the parameter settings of the SLS setup and can be improved by appropriate adjustment. In this context, the computational intelligence (CI) approach of multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) can be used to formulate the model for understanding the process behavior. MGGP develops the model structure and its coefficients automatically. Despite being widely applied, MGGP generates models that may not give satisfactory performance on test data. The underlying reason is the inappropriate formulation procedure of the multi-gene model and the difficulty in model selection. Therefore, the present work proposes a new CI approach (ensemble-based MGGP (EN-MGGP)) that makes use of statistical and classification strategies for improving its generalization. The EN-MGGP approach is applied to the open porosity data obtained from the experiments conducted on an SLS machine, and its performance is compared to that of the standardized MGGP. The proposed EN-MGGP model outperforms the standardized model and is proven to capture the dynamics of the SLS process by unveiling dominant input process parameters and the hidden non-linear relationships.",
99,Enhanced beads overlapping model for wire and arc additive manufacturing of multi-layer multi-bead metallic parts,"Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is a competitive technology for fabricating metallic parts with complex structure and geometry. It enables the fabrication of multi-layer multi-bead (MLMB) parts. The basis of planning the deposition paths is the beads overlapping model (BOM). The existing overlapping models consider only the geometric area of adjacent beads, but ignore the spreading of the melted weld beads. The objective of the research was to develop an enhanced BOM (E.BOM) for WAAM, which takes the spreading of the weld beads into consideration. A deposited bead spreads to the already deposited neighboring bead and as a consequence, its center point deviates from the center point of the fed (to be melted) wire. Experiments were designed to explore the relationships between the geometries of the beads, and the offset distance between the center of a weld bead and the center of the fed wire. An artificial neural network was used to predict the offset distance of a certain weld bead based on the results of the experiments. In addition, a reasoning algorithm was implemented to calculate the optimal distance between the centers of adjacent deposition paths in order to achieve a planned center distance between adjacent beads. This enables the control of the actual center distance of the adjacent beads according to an expected value. The E.BOM has been tested by validation experiments. On the one hand, it improves the surface flatness of layers of MLMB parts produced by WAAM. On the other hand, it prevents formation of defects inside the parts.",
100,The prediction of the building precision in the laser engineered net shaping process using advanced networks,"Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) is an advanced manufacturing technology, but it is difficult to control the depositing height (DH) of the prototype because there are many technology parameters influencing the forming process. The effect of main parameters (laser power, scanning speed and powder feeding rate) on the DH of single track is firstly analyzed, and then it shows that there is the complex nonlinear intrinsic relationship between them. In order to predict the DH, the back propagation (BP) based network improved with Adaptive learning rate and Momentum coefficient (AM) algorithm, and the least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) network are both adopted. The mapping relationship between above parameters and the DH is constructed according to training samples collected by LENS experiments, and then their generalization ability, function-approximating ability and real-time are contrastively investigated. The results show that although the predicted result by the BP-AM approximates the experimental result, above performance index of the LS-SVM are better than those of the BP-AM. Finally, high-definition thin-walled parts of AISI316L are successfully fabricated. Hence, the LS-SVM network is more suitable for the prediction of the DH.",
101,Investigation of dynamic elastic deformation of parts processed by fused deposition modeling additive manufacturing,"Fused deposition modeling (FDM) has been recognized as an effective technology to manufacture 3D dimensional parts directly from a digital computer aided design (CAD) model in a layer-by-layer style. Although it has become a significantly important manufacturing process, but it is still not well accepted additive manufacturing technology for load-carrying parts under dynamic and cyclic conditions due to many processing parameters affecting the part properties. The purpose of this study is to characterize the FDM manufactured parts by detecting how the individual and interactive FDM process parameters will influence the performance of manufactured products under dynamic and cyclic conditions. Experiments were conducted through fractional factorial design and artificial neural network (ANN). Effect of each parameter on the dynamic modulus of elasticity was investigated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique. Furthermore, optimal processing parameters were determined and validated by conducting verification experiment. The results showed that both ANN and fractional factorial models provided good quality predictions, yet the ANN showed the superiority of a properly trained ANN in capturing the nonlinear relationship of the system over fractional factorial for both data fitting and estimation capabilities.",
102, Influence of processing parameters on creep and recovery behavior of FDM manufactured part using definitive screening design and ANN,The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of process parameters of fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing process on viscoelastic responses (creep compliance and recoverable compliance) of FDM built parts using a novel experimental design technique.,
103,Experimental study on the 3D‐printed plastic parts and predicting the mechanical properties using artificial neural networks,"This study investigates the mechanical properties of 3D‐printed plastic parts fabricated using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). For this purpose, a 3D printer named KASAME was designed and built by the researchers. The test samples were fabricated using polylactic acid (PLA). The experiments were conducted using three melt temperatures (190°C, 205°C, and 220°C), four layer thickness values (0.06 mm, 0.10 mm, 0.19 mm, and 0.35 mm), and three raster pattern orientations (+45°/−45° [the crisscross pattern], horizontal and vertical). Tensile strength tests were performed to determine tensile strength values of the samples and fracture surfaces were also analyzed. Using artificial neural networks, a mathematical model for the tensile test results was generated corresponding to the raster pattern employed in 3D fabrication. Tensile strength tests indicated that melt temperature, layer thickness, and raster pattern orientation had a significant effect on the tensile strengths of the samples. According to the result of the experiment, the maximum average tensile strength values were observed for the samples fabricated using the crisscross raster pattern. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) table shows the raster pattern (PCR) value of 48.68% was obtained with the highest degree of influence. With respect to R2, the best performing artificial neural network model, with test and training values of 0.999199 and 0.999997, respectively, was observed to be the crisscross raster pattern.",
104,An investigation on sliding wear of FDM built parts,"Present work focuses on extensive study to understand the effect of five important parameters such as layer thickness, part build orientation, raster angle, raster width and air gap on the sliding wear of test specimen built through fused deposition modelling process (FDM). The study provides insight into complex dependency of wear on process parameters and proposes a statistically validated predictive equation. Microphotographs are used to explain the mechanism of wear. The equation is used to find optimal parameter setting through quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO). As FDM process is highly complex one and process parameters influence the responses in a non linear manner, artificial neural network (ANN) are employed to confirm the results of present study.",
105,Experimental investigation and empirical modelling of FDM process for compressive strength improvement,"Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is gaining distinct advantage in manufacturing industries because of its ability to manufacture parts with complex shapes without any tooling requirement and human interface. The properties of FDM built parts exhibit high dependence on process parameters and can be improved by setting parameters at suitable levels. Anisotropic and brittle nature of build part makes it important to study the effect of process parameters to the resistance to compressive loading for enhancing service life of functional parts. Hence, the present work focuses on extensive study to understand the effect of five important parameters such as layer thickness, part build orientation, raster angle, raster width and air gap on the compressive stress of test specimen. The study not only provides insight into complex dependency of compressive stress on process parameters but also develops a statistically validated predictive equation. The equation is used to find optimal parameter setting through quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO). As FDM process is a highly complex one and process parameters influence the responses in a non linear manner, compressive stress is predicted using artificial neural network (ANN) and is compared with predictive equation.",
106,In-situ monitoring additive manufacturing process with AI edge computing,"In-situ monitoring system can be used to monitor the quality of additive manufacturing (AM) processes. In the case of digital image correlation (DIC) based in-situ monitoring systems, high-speed cameras were used to capture images of high resolutions. This paper proposed a novel in-situ monitoring system to accelerate the process of digital images using artificial intelligence (AI) edge computing board. It built a visual transformer based video super resolution (ViTSR) network to reconstruct high resolution (HR) videos frames. Fully convolutional network (FCN) was used to simultaneously extract the geometric characteristics of molten pool and plasma arc during the AM processes. Compared with 6 state-of-the-art super resolution methods, ViTSR ranks first in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). The PSNR of ViTSR for 4x super resolution reached 38.16 dB on test data with input size of 75 pixels x 75 pixels. Inference time of ViTSR and FCN was optimized to 50.97 ms and 67.86 ms on AI edge board after operator fusion and model pruning. The total inference time of the proposed system was 118.83 ms, which meets the requirement of real-time quality monitoring with low cost in-situ monitoring equipment during AM processes. The proposed system achieved an accuracy of 96.34% on the multi-objects extraction task and can be applied to different AM processes.",
107,A Transfer Learning-Based Multi-Fidelity Point-Cloud Neural Network Approach for Melt Pool Modeling in Additive Manufacturing,"Melt pool modeling is critical for model-based uncertainty quantification (UQ) and quality control in metallic additive manufacturing (AM). Finite element (FE) simulation for thermal modeling in metal AM, however, is tedious and time-consuming. This paper presents a multifidelity point-cloud neural network method (MF-PointNN) for surrogate modeling of melt pool based on FE simulation data. It merges the feature representations of the low-fidelity (LF) analytical model and high-fidelity (HF) FE simulation data through the theory of transfer learning (TL). A basic PointNN is first trained using LF data to construct a correlation between the inputs and thermal field of analytical models. Then, the basic PointNN is updated and fine-tuned using the small size of HF data to build the MF-PointNN. The trained MF-PointNN allows for efficient mapping from input variables and spatial positions to thermal histories, and thereby efficiently predicts the three-dimensional melt pool. Results of melt pool modeling of electron beam additive manufacturing (EBAM) of Ti-6Al-4V under uncertainty demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",
108,Development of Cloud-Edge Collaborative Digital Twin System for FDM Additive Manufacturing,"The physical and virtual access of manufacturing equipment to the cloud platform is an important direction of cloud manufacturing research, but the current research results in this direction are not enough to support the ""landing"" and wide application of cloud manufacturing model. In the traditional cloud manufacturing model, the direct access of manufacturing equipment to the cloud brings huge network pressure and unbearable latency, and also poses a privacy and security risk. Aiming at the cloudification of manufacturing equipment in the cloud manufacturing environment, the 3D printer is selected as the research object, and a cloud-edge collaboration architecture for 3D printers based on digital twin is proposed. To solve the lack of network reliability brought about by traditional cloudification, time-sensitive services are deployed at the edge, realizing the local extension of cloud services. The digital twin information model of FDM additive manufacturing is defined. Real time controlling and monitoring based on digital twin is realized. By cloud-edge collaboration, an application case is implemented, which verifies the effectiveness of the system and provides a reference solution for the cloudification of other manufacturing equipment in the environment of cloud manufacturing.",
109,Federated learning-based semantic segmentation for pixel-wise defect detection in additive manufacturing,"Semantic segmentation is a promising machine learning (ML) method for highly precise fine-scale defect detection and part qualification in additive manufacturing (AM). Most existing segmentation methods utilize convolutional neural network architectures that require large quantities of training data. However, obtaining sufficient data—both in quality and quantity—to train such models is expensive and time-consuming for individual AM practitioners, which severely limits the deployment of semantic segmentation in a data-scarce production environment. Similar data may be readily available with other AM practitioners that cannot be pooled together for conventional centralized learning (CL) due to its sensitive nature or conflicts of interest. This paper develops a federated learning (FL)-based method to simultaneously alleviate the constraints of data availability and data privacy. A U-Net architecture is created for semantic segmentation and is trained under the FL framework. The effectiveness of the developed FL-based semantic segmentation approach is demonstrated using case studies on layer-wise images from the laser powder bed fusion process. Results show that the proposed technique achieves a comparable defect detection performance with CL, which shares data among manufacturers/clients but does not preserve data privacy, and significantly outperforms individual learning, where each manufacturer trains a model using its own data. Additionally, the impact of data distribution across clients, incentives to participate in FL, and the learning dynamics of FL are discussed in detail. It is found that data diversity within and across clients improves FL performance, and FL does not involve a significantly higher training cost compared to CL. Lastly, transfer learning is shown to enhance FL generalizability, thus allowing more manufacturers with heterogeneous machines or technologies to benefit from participating in a data federation. Overall, this work puts forth FL as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative ML in AM process control.",
110,Knowledge graph embedding learning system for defect diagnosis in additive manufacturing,"Since additive manufacturing involves complex physical processes and is influenced by many process parameters, it is challenging to manufacture defect-free products. To explore the causes of defects and obtain better product quality, exploring the relations among these factors is necessary. The knowledge graph is a powerful technique to express the relationships between entities and has been applied to many real-world tasks, such as disease diagnosis, recommendation systems, and traffic prediction. In this paper, a novel knowledge graph embedding learning system is presented, in which a designed knowledge graph ontology for AM and fact triples collected from the literature are utilized for the construction of a knowledge graph for defect diagnosis in additive manufacturing (KDDAM). A relational enhanced graph convolutional network is proposed to uncover new hidden relations among parameters, effects, defects, and product quality in the KDDAM. To validate the performance of the proposed model, we conducted many experiments on KDDAM and compared it with other baseline and state-of-the-art models. Our model yielded better results in two traditional link prediction metrics, with an MRR of 0.316 and 0.7, respectively. In addition, a case study shows that our model can discover new causes of defects to help us optimize the process.",
111,Geometrical defect detection for additive manufacturing with machine learning models,"This study proposed a scheme based on Machine Learning (ML) models to detect geometric defects of additively manufactured objects. The ML models are trained with synthetic 3D point clouds with defects and then applied to detect defects in actual production. Using synthetic 3D point clouds rather than experimental data could save a huge amount of training time and costs associated with many prints for each design. Besides distance differences of individual points between source and target point clouds, this scheme uses a new concept called “patch” to capture macro-level information about nearby points for ML training and implementation. Numerical comparisons of prediction results on experimental data with different shapes showed that the proposed scheme outperformed the existing Z-difference method in the literature. Five ML methods (Bagging of Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, K-nearest Neighbors and Linear Supported Vector Machine) were compared under various conditions, such as different point cloud densities and defect sizes. Bagging and Random Forest were found the two best models regarding predictability; and the right patch size was found to be at 20. The proposed ML-based scheme is applicable to in-situ defect detection during additive manufacturing with the aid of a proper 3D data acquisition system.",
112,A study on power-controlled wire-arc additive manufacturing using a data-driven surrogate model,"Wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) provides an alternative for the production of various metal products needed in medium to large batch sizes due to its high deposition rates. However, the cyclic heat input in WAAM may cause local overheating. To avoid adverse effects on the performance of the part, interlayer dwelling and active cooling are used, but these measures increase the process time. Alternatively, the temperature during the WAAM process could be controlled by optimizing the welding power. The present work aims at introducing and implementing a novel temperature management approach by adjusting the weld-bead cross-section along with the welding power to reduce the heat accumulation in the WAAM process. The temperature evolution during welding of weld beads of different cross-sections is investigated and a database of the relation between optimal welding power for beads of various sizes and different pre-heating temperatures was established. The numerical results are validated experimentally with a block-shaped geometry. The results show that by the proposed method, the test shape made was welded with lower energy consumption and process time as compared to conventional constant-power WAAM. The proposed approach efficiently manages the thermal input and reduces the need for pausing the process. Hence, the defects related to heat accumulation might be reduced, and the process efficiency increased.",
113,On the laser additive manufacturing of high-entropy alloys: A critical assessment of in-situ monitoring techniques and their suitability,"High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have gained increasing attention from the industrial and scientific communities due to their extraordinary thermo-physical properties. Introducing the laser additive manufacturing (LAM) technique as a viable fabrication process of HEAs provides many advantages over traditional methods. One of the main challenges facing widespread industrial utilization of LAM is the limited ability to monitor and predict various types of defects during the printing process. Several operando (in-situ) monitoring techniques have been developed to detect failure when printing commonly used LAM alloys, such as stainless steel, titanium, and nickel alloys. The adaptability and effectiveness of these techniques to LAM of HEAs have neither been reviewed nor established. In this work, we highlight the unique properties of HEAs, discuss current traditional fabrication methods of HEAs, and present recent advances in LAM of HEAs and the advantages over traditional techniques. In addition, we present a comprehensive review of the current in-situ monitoring techniques applied in LAM for commonly used alloys, followed by a critical assessment of the adaptability of these techniques to the LAM of HEAs. Since HEAs are composed of multiple constituents in varying proportions with a variable size distribution, morphology, and melting temperature, the heat distribution at the laser-material regime fluctuates, resulting in a complex thermal gradient with a non-uniform melt pool morphology and the generation of corresponding defects. Existing in-situ techniques are not explicitly designed to handle such a complex thermal distribution, and their effectiveness can be compromised. Therefore, conducting this critical review and assessment is urgently needed. Besides, a novel in-situ monitoring technique design has been proposed based on the difficulties identified during literature analysis.",
114,CenterNet-based defect detection for additive manufacturing,"Additive manufacturing (AM) has been widely used in the fabrication of optical components. However, surface defects generated during the AM process have an adverse effect on surface quality. Although some studies have explored the defect features based on the processing of information including images, acoustic signals, thermal history, etc., they focus mainly on defect classification or one type of defect detection. Over recent years, convolution neural networks have displayed promising performance in object detection in images in various fields. Therefore, in this paper, to detect and characterize surface defects more comprehensively and accurately, a novel defect detection model based on CenterNet is presented to extract the defect features, including type, location and count simultaneously, in which there are four output heads to predict heatmaps, object size, local offset, and density map, respectively. Moreover, count loss is added in the original objective function to boost the detection performance. To perform the model validation, surface defect dataset is captured through scanning electron microscope on the surfaces of the workpiece made of 316L fabricated by AM. A series of experiments was conducted and the proposed model achieved better detection accuracy on defect dataset compared with other state-of-the-art models.",
115,Toward online layer-wise surface Morphology measurement in additive manufacturing using a deep learning-based approach,"Layer-wise surface morphology information plays a critical role in the quality monitoring and control of additive manufacturing (AM) processes. 3D scan technologies can provide effective means to obtain accurate surface morphological data. However, most of the existing 3D scan technologies are time consuming due to either contact mode or algorithm complexity, which are not capable of obtaining the surface morphology data in an online manner during the printing process. To implement online layer-wise surface morphological data acquisition in AM processes, one practical solution is to model the correlation between 2D images and 3D point cloud data. In practice, since this correlation is usually highly complex due to the high dimensionality and non-linearity, it is usually impractical to find an explicit mathematical transfer function to quantify this correlation effectively. To address this issue, a deep learning-based model is developed in this study, in which a powerful deep learning algorithm, namely, convolutional neural network (CNN), is incorporated. With the trained CNN model, the 3D surface data can be predicted directly without the relatively time consuming triangulation computation by the 3D scanner. Thus, the speed of surface data acquisition and morphology measurement can be improved. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology, both simulation and real-world AM case studies were performed. The results show that the prediction accuracy using the proposed method is promising. In terms of averaged relative prediction error, it can be mostly lower than 10% in the experiments. Therefore, the proposed method has a great potential for online layer-wise surface morphology measurement in AM.",
116,Explainable AI for layer-wise emission prediction in laser fusion,"The dynamic behavior of melt pools in powder bed-based laser fusion is very challenging to model using physics-based models and conventional black-box data-driven models. Explainable Artificial Intelligence is developed in this work to advance the understanding of convoluted links of non-sequential process physics, online time series sensing data, and process anomaly (e.g., overheating in the melt pool). A Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)-enabled Deep Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (DNN-LSTM) model has been developed as a mechanism to integrate process parameter knowledge with process history information through online sensing data while providing local and global model interpretation and transparency.",
117,Physics-informed deep learning of gas flow-melt pool multi-physical dynamics during powder bed fusion,"The effect of inert gas on melt pool dynamics has been largely overlooked but is crucial for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Physics-based simulation models are computationally expensive while data-driven models lack transparency and need massive training data. This work presents a physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) model to accurately predict the temperature and velocity fields in the melting domain using only a small training data. The PIDL model can also learn unknown model constants (e.g., Reynolds number and Peclet number) of the governing equations. Furthermore, the robust PIDL algorithm converges very fast by enforcing physics via soft penalty constraints.",
118,A novel quality inspection method for aerosol jet printed sensors through infrared imaging and machine learning,"The quality of printed electronic sensors by aerosol jet printing (AJP) process is hard to guarantee due to an insufficient reproducibility of the AJP process. This paper proposes a novel quality inspection method to identify defects on the printed sensor by AJP process using infrared imaging and machine learning. Potentially defective regions with high temperature distributions on printed lines are estimated from the infrared imaging when the current is applied. Demanded regions for the repair are identified by a machine learning algorithm. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method has been demonstrated by repair experiments.",
119,Feature Engineering for Surrogate Models of Consolidation Degree in Additive Manufacturing,Surrogate models (SM) serve as a proxy to the physics- and experiment-based models to significantly lower the cost of prediction while providing high accuracy. Building an SM for additive manufacturing (AM) process suffers from high dimensionality of inputs when part geometry or tool-path is considered in addition to the high cost of generating data from either physics-based models or experiments. This paper engineers features for a surrogate model to predict the consolidation degree in the fused filament fabrication process. Our features are informed by the physics of the underlying thermal processes and capture the characteristics of the part’s geometry and the deposition process. Our model is learned from medium-size data generated using a physics-based thermal model coupled with the polymer healing theory to determine the consolidation degree. Our results demonstrate high accuracy (>90%) of consolidation degree prediction at a low computational cost (four orders of magnitude faster than the numerical model).,
120,Digital Twin-enabled Collaborative Data Management for Metal Additive Manufacturing Systems,"Metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) has been attracting a continuously increasing attention due to its great advantages compared to traditional subtractive manufacturing in terms of higher design flexibility, shorter development time, lower tooling cost, and fewer production wastes. However, the lack of process robustness, stability and repeatability caused by the unsolved complex relationships between material properties, product design, process parameters, process signatures, post AM processes and product quality has significantly impeded its broad acceptance in the industry. To facilitate efficient implementation of advanced data analytics in metal AM, which would support the development of intelligent process monitoring, control and optimisation, this paper proposes a novel Digital Twin (DT)-enabled collaborative data management framework for metal AM systems, where a Cloud DT communicates with distributed Edge DTs in different product lifecycle stages. A metal AM product data model that contains a comprehensive list of specific product lifecycle data is developed to support the collaborative data management. The feasibility and advantages of the proposed framework are validated through the practical implementation in a distributed metal AM system developed in the project MANUELA. A representative application scenario of cloud-based and deep learning-enabled metal AM layer defect analysis is also presented. The proposed DT-enabled collaborative data management has shown great potential in enhancing fundamental understanding of metal AM processes, developing simulation and prediction models, reducing development times and costs, and improving product quality and production efficiency.",
121,Generation and categorisation of surface texture data using a modified progressively growing adversarial network,"As machine learning becomes more popular in the precision engineering sector, the need for large datasets of measurement data increases. Due to the often manual, user dependent and labour-intensive measurement processes, collecting a large amount of data is often infeasible. It would, therefore, be desirable to collect a small amount of data on which to train a model to generate synthetic data that is representative of the real measurement data. To this end, we present an approach to numerical surface texture generation based on a progressively growing generative adversarial network. We show that by encoding height data into grayscale values within an image, the network can create realistic synthetic surface data both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach is general to any encoded surface; we demonstrate the model trained on two example datasets consisting of surfaces from different manufacturing processes and measured with different techniques. We finally present an extension to the generator model which automatically categorises the produced surfaces, allowing a surface of a desired category to be generated. Finally, we calculate the distributions of areal surface texture parameters for each type of surface and show that there is good agreement between the synthetic and real data.",
122,Autoxnomous in-situ correction of fused deposition modeling printers using computer vision and deep learning,"Fused deposition modeling, a widely used additive manufacturing process, currently faces challenges in printed part quality such as under-extrusion and over-extrusion. In this paper, a real-time monitoring and autonomous correction system is developed, where a deep learning model and a feedback loop is used to modify 3D-printing parameters iteratively and adaptively. Results show that our system is capable of detecting in-plane printing conditions and in-situ correct defects faster than the speed of a human’s response. The fundamental elements in the framework proposed can be extended to various 3D-printing technologies to reliably fabricate high-performance materials in challenging environments without human interaction.",
123,An improved fault diagnosis approach for FDM process with acoustic T emission,"The reliability and performance of additive manufacturing (AM) machines affect the product quality and manufacturing cost. Developing effective health monitoring and prognostics methods is critical to AM productivity. Yet limited work is done on machine health monitoring. Recently, the application of acoustic emission sensor (AE) to the fault diagnosis of material extrusion or fused deposition modeling process was demonstrated. One challenge in real-time process monitoring is processing the large amount of data collected by high-fidelity sensors for diagnostics and prognostics. In this paper, the efficiency of machine state identification from AE data is significantly improved with reduced feature space dimension. In the proposed method, features extracted in both time and frequency domains are combined and then reduced with the linear discriminant analysis. An unsupervised density based clustering method is applied to classify and recognize different machine states of the extruder. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively identify machine states of the extruder even within a much smaller feature space.",

Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) presents key opportunities in the tool refurbishment. However, the typical tool paths via DMD consist of alternated smooth segments and sharp corners. Here, the fluctuation of energy density and powder quantities often cause critical geometrical deviations to the tool restored sections. This work presents a novel machine learning based prediction approach that characterizes paths using features associated to process parameters and performed geometry. The benefits of the approach have been validated on toolpaths, which typically characterize a tool refurbishment process.",

126,Interlayer closed-loop control of forming geometries for wire and arc additive manufacturing based on fuzzy-logic inference,"The deposition process of wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is usually planned based on a bead geometry model (BGM), which represents the relationship between bead geometries (e.g. width, height) and required deposition parameters. However, the actual deposition situation may deviate from the one in which the BGM is built, such as varied heat dissipation conditions, resulting in morphological changes of deposited beads and geometrical errors in the formed parts. In this paper, a novel control mechanism for enhancing the fabrication accuracy of WAAM based on fuzzy-logic inference is proposed. It considers the geometrical errors measured on already deposited layers and deposition context to adjust deposition parameters of beads in the subsequent layer, forming an interlayer closed-loop control (ICLC) mechanism. This paper not only presents the theoretical fundamentals of the ICLC mechanism but also reports the technical details about utilizing this mechanism to control the forming height of multi-layer multi-bead (MLMB) components. A fuzzy-logic inference machine was applied as the core component for calculating speed change of bead deposition based on height error and previously applied change. In terms of validation, the effectiveness of the proposed control mechanism and the implemented controller was investigated through both simulative studies and real-life experiments. The fabricated cuboid blocks showed good accuracy in height with a maximum error of 0.20 mm. The experimental results implied that the proposed ICLC approach facilitates deposition continuity of WAAM, and thus enables process automation for robotic manufacturing.",
127,Fast surrogate modeling using dimensionality reduction in model inputs and field output: Application to additive manufacturing,"A novel approach to surrogate modeling motivated by recent advancements in parameter dimension reduction is proposed. Specifically, the approach aims to speed-up surrogate modeling for mapping multiple input variables to a field quantity of interest. Computational efficiency is accomplished by first identifying principal components (PC) and corresponding features in the output field data. A map from inputs to each feature is considered, and the active subspace (AS) methodology is used to capture their relationship in a low-dimensional subspace in the input domain. Thus, the PCAS method accomplishes dimension reduction in the input as well as the output. The method is demonstrated on a realistic problem pertaining to variability in residual stress in an additively manufactured component due to the stochastic nature of the process variables and material properties. The resulting surrogate model is exploited for uncertainty propagation, and identification of stress hotspots in the part. Additionally, the surrogate model is used for global sensitivity analysis to quantify relative contributions of the uncertain inputs to stress variability. Our findings based on the considered application are indicative of enormous potential for computational gains in such analyses, especially in generating training data, and enabling advancements in control and optimization of additive manufacturing processes.",
128,"Machine learning surrogate modeling toward the design
of lattice-structured heat sinks fabricated by additive manufacturing","Metal additive manufacturing (AM) enables the fabrication of lattice-structured heat sinks with enhanced heat transfer properties. The lattice structural features for enhancing heat transfer and suppressing pressure loss need to be clarified. To describe the structural features dominating heat transfer and pressure loss, eleven structural parameters consisting of three groups, namely the area, hydraulic diameter, and effective flow path, are proposed and used as inputs for the neural network (NN) surrogate model. The surrogate model precisely and quickly predicts the heat transfer property and pressure loss simulated by computational fluid dynamics. The random forest feature importance is used to select necessary and sufficient structural features. Four parameters describing the bottleneck in the flow pathway, surface area, and intricate structures are selected. Even when only the selected four parameters are used, the NN model maintains a high prediction performance, suggesting that the four parameters are sufficient for describing the heat transfer and pressure loss. Four parameters are used to discuss the design concept for lattice-structured heat sinks. An appropriately intricate lattice structure exhibits improved heat transfer and reduced pressure loss compared to a simple lattice structure. This study provides new insights into the design of lattice-structured heat sinks fabricated by AM.",
129,A framework for multi-objective optimisation of 3D part-build orientation with a desired angular resolution in additive manufacturing processes,"In additive manufacturing processes, the part build orientation (PBO) is one of the most important factors that can affect the characteristics of the quality product such as the amount of support structure and the surface roughness. In most previous methods, the optimal PBO cannot be determined with high precision and accuracy in 3D space. In this paper, to find the precise and accurate optimal PBO with a desired angular accuracy, a new Taguchi-based method, called the Zooming-Taguchi method, is proposed. The proposed simulation-based method can precisely find the optimal PBO in absence of the noise effects. In order to find the optimal PBO with the desired angular resolution, the zooming procedure is iteratively carried out on factor levels through a clustering strategy. Finally, to validate the proposed method, two case studies are considered and the obtained results are compared with conventional methods in the literature and the experimental results.",
130,Multidisciplinary design optimization in design for additive manufacturing,"Design for additive manufacturing (AM) involves decision making in various design domains, including product design, material selection, and process planning. In practice, engineers typically adopt a sequential design process to optimize these design domains in consecutive order. However, coupling factors, e.g. shared variables, related constraints, and conflicting objectives, are not sufficiently considered within the sequential design process, resulting in an inefficient workflow and suboptimal design solutions. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multidisciplinary design optimization framework to simultaneously optimize different domains, which enables rapid exploration and complete exploitation of the AM design space under complex constraints. More specifically, the proposed framework is based on the concurrent optimization method, which coordinates the optimization of different design domains by allowing an automated exchange of design information. Also, the framework utilizes the surrogate modeling approach to approximate high-fidelity simulations for facilitating the iterative process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated with two examples, a plate with a hole design and a hook design, which involve multiple design objectives from both process and structure domains, i.e. the print time, print area, strain energy, and maximum von Mises stress.",
131,Optimization of surface roughness and dimensional accuracy in LPBF additive manufacturing,"Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is one of the most promising additive manufacturing technologies. It has been utilized in the high level and stringent requirements fields such as aerospace and biomedicine industries. However, compared to subtractive manufacturing, the relatively poor surface finish and dimensional accuracy of the LPBF part hamper its widespread applications. In this work, a data-driven framework is proposed to obtain optimal process parameters of LPBF to get satisfactory surface roughness and dimensional accuracy. The effects of key process parameters on the surface roughness and dimensional accuracy are analyzed. Specifically, a machine learning technique is defined to reflect the dimensional accuracy and the surface roughness of the as-built products under different combinations of process parameters. Considering the limited experimental data, a machine learning model is introduced to predict the surface roughness and dimensional accuracy in the whole process parameters space. Then the predicted value is considered as an objective value when using the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to search the global optimal process parameters. In the verification experiments, LPBF parts with better surface finish and dimensional accuracy were obtained with optimized process parameters which indicates that the optimized results are consistent with the experimental results.",
132,Image analysis-based closed loop quality control for additive manufacturing T with fused filament fabrication,"Additive manufacturing (AM) is a powerful technology for fabrication of components with complex geometries using a variety of materials. However, one of the major challenges in the AM industry is how to ensure product quality and consistency by detecting and then mitigating the defects, which otherwise can severely deteriorate the quality of AM products and even the sustainability of AM technology. Although optimizing machine parameter settings offline and post-processing of AM products can improve the quality, the effects may be still limited, particularly for the parts with complex geometries. The objective of this study is to develop an image-based closed-loop quality control system for a typical AM process, namely, fused filament fabrication (FFF). This system is implemented by a customized online image acquisition system with a proposed image diagnosis-based feedback quality control method. Based on this novel approach, the typical quality issues can be addressed by efficient and effective defect mitigation via online automatic machine parameter adjustment. The case studies based on an actual FFF platform demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.",
133,Investigation of process-structure-property relationships in polymer T extrusion based additive manufacturing through in situ high speed imaging and thermal conductivity measurements,"Additive manufacturing has gained significant research attention due to multiple advantages over traditional manufacturing technologies. A fundamental understanding of the relationships between process parameters, microstructure and functional properties of built parts is critical for optimizing the additive manufacturing process and building parts with desired properties. This is also critical for a multi-functional part where the process needs to be optimized with respect to disparate performance requirements such as mechanical strength and thermal conductivity. This paper presents in situ high speed imaging and build-direction thermal conductivity measurements of polymer extrusion based additively manufactured parts in order to understand the effect of process parameters such as raster speed, infill percentage and layer height on build-direction thermal conductivity. Measurements of thermal conductivity using a one-dimensional heat flux method are correlated with in situ process images obtained from a high speed camera as well as cross section images of the built part. Results indicate strong dependence of build-direction thermal conductivity on raster speed, layer thickness and infill percentage, which is corroborated by high speed imaging of the printing process at different values of these process parameters. Key trade-offs between process throughput and thermal properties are also identified. In addition to enhancing our fundamental understanding of polymer extrusion based additive manufacturing and its influence on thermal properties of built parts, results presented here may facilitate process optimization towards parts with desired thermal and multi-functional properties.",
134,In-situ optimization of thermoset composite additive manufacturing via deep learning and computer vision,"With the advent of extrusion additive manufacturing (AM), fabrication of high-performance thermoset composites without the need of tooling has become a reality. However, finding an optimal set of printing parameters for these thermoset composites during extrusion requires tedious experimentation as composite ink properties can vary significantly with respect to environmental parameters such as temperature and relative humidity. Addressing this challenge, this study presents a novel optimization framework that utilizes computer vision and deep learning (DL) to optimize the calibration and printing processes of thermoset composite AM. Unlike traditional DL models where printing parameters are determined prior to printing, our proposed framework dynamically and autonomously adjusts the printing parameters during extrusion. A novel DL integrated extrusion AM system is developed to determine the optimal printing parameters including print speed, road width, and layer height for a given composite ink. This closed loop system is consisted of a computer communicating with an extrusion AM system, a camera to perform in-situ imaging and several high accuracy convolution neural networks (CNNs) selecting the ideal process parameters for composite AM. The results show that our proposed process optimization framework was able to autonomously determine these parameters for a carbon fiber-composite ink. Consequently, specimens with complex geometries could be fabricated without visible defects and with maximum fiber alignment and thus enhancing the mechanical performance of the specimen’s composite material. Moreover, our proposed framework minimizes a labor-intensive procedure required to additively manufacture thermoset composites by optimizing the extrusion process without any user intervention.",

The combined objective error was achieved at 2.45%. The errors obtained is attributed to the hardware and/or the variations in the operating conditions. The study highlighted a simple but workable approach for predicting the surface roughness along various surface of FDM built parts.",
